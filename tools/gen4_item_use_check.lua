-- CAN SINNOH'S ITEMS ACTUALLY BE USED?
--
-- Reported from play: "pokeballs arent working in platinum they give an error
-- not the place this item should be used, make sure all items are cabable of
-- being used properly."
--
-- TWO CAUSES, both of them the same shape: a second cartridge spelling a thing
-- differently from the first, and one file knowing only the first spelling.
--
--  1. THE BALL POCKET.  Every one of Platinum's sixteen balls carries
--     `pocket = "POKE_BALLS"`; Emerald's twelve carry `"BALL"`.
--     `ItemEffects.isBall` knew one of those, so no Sinnoh ball was a ball and
--     `use` fell past the ball branch to the refusal.
--
--  2. EVERY MEDICINE IN THE GAME.  The rest of `use` dispatches on a NAME that
--     `alias` reads from the item record's `key`. A Platinum item record has no
--     `key` -- the cache is 446 rows keyed 0..445, published again as
--     ITEM_000.. because the bag's keys are strings -- so a Potion answered
--     "ITEM_017", every name test failed, and it too ended at the refusal.
--
-- The fix for the second one is not a name table. `ItemData.partyUseParam`
-- (pokeplatinum include/item.h) is a twenty-byte `ItemPartyParam` naming every
-- effect the item has on a party member, the extractor already writes it out,
-- and `ItemEffects.gen4RecordFor` decodes it into the record shape `gen3Use`
-- already runs. Section 1 checks the decode against the shipped bytes; section
-- 4 runs the items.
--
-- Usage: texlua tools/gen4_item_use_check.lua [platinum/data/generated]
--                                             [emerald/data/generated]

-- A LOVE THAT DOES NOTHING.  `ItemEffects` reaches `src.core.Sound`, which
-- indexes the global `love` on its way to playing a heal chime; headless there
-- is none, and the run died in the middle of section 4 rather than reporting
-- anything. Silent is the right behaviour for a check.
