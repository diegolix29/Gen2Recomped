-- Every throwable ball must resolve to a complete set of throw frames, both in
-- the `gen4_graphics` cache and on disk.
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS.  The ball throw art has been extracted for a long time --
-- `ball_throws/` is a declared family in `Gen4Battle.OBJ_FAMILIES` -- and
-- nothing named which set belonged to which ball, so nothing could use it and
-- nothing noticed if a set went missing.  `Gen4Battle.ballThrowFor` names them
-- now, and this is what keeps that naming honest against a real install: the
-- container this was derived in only ever sees one cache.
--
--   lua tools/gen4_ball_throw_check.lua [path/to/platinum/data/generated]

-- Exits non-zero if any ball is short a frame.
