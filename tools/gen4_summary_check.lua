-- The slot was declared when the screen was written and never drawn into, so
-- for its whole life the page came up as numbers beside an empty plate.  That
-- is the kind of fault nothing reports: the screen works, the words are right,
-- and the only symptom is an absence.
--
-- Two numbers are being checked, and they are checked the way each was got:
--   the CENTRE is stated by the cartridge and independently measured off the
--   art, so the check is that the two MEET;
--   the MIRROR is a reading of a flag, so the check is that the decision
--   function makes both answers and does not mirror a cache that has no flag
--   to read.
