-- WHAT THIS PROVES: that a diggable wall is a wall face with floor in front of
-- it, measured against the real Underground rather than asserted; and that the
-- cluster the game spawns lands on those cells, inside the main area, within ten
-- tiles of its centre.
--
-- THE TRAP THIS FILE EXISTS TO PIN DOWN: `TerrainCollisionManager_CheckCollision`
-- returning TRUE for BLOCKED. Read the other way, `canSpawnAt` becomes "a floor
-- cell with a wall beside it" -- which still runs, still returns plausible
-- numbers, and puts every excavation site on the ground instead of in a wall.
-- Section 2 pins the polarity by measuring both readings: the right one keeps
-- 24,824 cells, the inverted one keeps a different number, and section 5 asserts
-- every spawned spot is on a cell the map calls solid.
