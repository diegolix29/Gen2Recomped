-- WHOSE BACK IS THE PLAYER FIGHTING WITH, AND IN WHOSE COLOURS?
--
-- Reported from play, on Platinum: "my trainers backsprite and possibly others
-- are drawing with a red hue overlay rather than their proper colors."
--
-- It is not a tint and it is not a palette decode fault. The chain is:
--
--   `field.playerForms.boy.back` is Lucas's own back sprite and the cache has
--   carried it all along; `Sprites.playerPath` picks it correctly; the record
--   has no `trueColor`, so `playerPath` answers false; `BattleState` then calls
--   `getImage(path, namedPalette(data, "MEWMON"), false)` -- and a false there
--   means REPAINT THIS to the four-shade SGB ramp.
--
-- `MEWMON` is the palette the intro uses while the back pic is up, because
-- wBattleMonSpecies is still 0 when SET_PAL_BATTLE runs. Mew's palette is pink.
-- So a full-colour Lucas is repainted in Mew's colours, which is the report.
--
-- The flag already exists and is already honoured -- Crystal's KRIS and Hoenn's
-- WALLY both set it for exactly this reason. `Sprites.markFormsTrueColor` says
-- it for a generation whose art is in colour by construction.
--
-- Usage: texlua tools/gen4_player_pic_check.lua [platinum/data/generated]
