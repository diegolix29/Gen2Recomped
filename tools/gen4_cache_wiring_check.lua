-- tools/gen4_cache_wiring_check.lua -- the nineteenth standing check, and the
-- only one that measures the SEAM between the importer and the running game
-- rather than either side of it.
--
-- WHY IT EXISTS. Every other check in this directory proves a table is right.
-- None of them asks whether the engine ever opens it. `Data` loads a Gen 4
-- table by its FILE NAME off an explicit list, so a stage that writes a name
-- the list does not carry produces a perfectly correct file that nothing reads,
-- forever, with no error anywhere.
--
-- THAT HAS NOW HAPPENED THREE TIMES. `gen4_species_sprites` was the first and
-- its own comment in Data.lua records it. `gen4_move_anims` and `gen4_particles`
-- were the second and third, and they were expensive: the move-animation player
-- is 800 lines with 42 checks behind it, and `Gen4MoveAnimPlayer.new` reads
-- `data.gen4_move_anims` while the stage wrote `move_anims.lua`. The
-- constructor returned nil on every boot. Every move in Platinum fell back to
-- the generic animation and nothing logged a word, which is exactly what the
-- player reported: "scratch doesnt work and doesnt show a move animation or
-- fx". Two whole subsystems, proved correct, wired to nothing.
--
-- A per-stage check cannot see this. The stage passes, the table is right, the
-- cache is written -- the fault is in the space between two files, which is
-- why it needs a check of its own.

-- 3: THE CLAIM. Every table the importer writes is either opened by the engine
-- or is a KNOWN write-only dump.
--
-- The eight below are named, not pattern-matched, and the set must be EXACTLY
-- these eight. None of them is read by anything -- `grep` finds no reader in
-- src/ for any of the eight -- and that is legitimate only because each one's
-- CONTENT reaches the runtime through a table that IS opened: the Gen 4
-- importer lowers its own intermediate shapes into the engine's shared ones
-- before writing the cache, and dumps the intermediates beside them.
--
-- !! `gen4_overworld` WAS THE NINTH AND IS GONE FROM THIS LIST, because "no
-- reader in src/" stopped being true of it and nothing noticed. It is lowered
-- into `sprites` AND it is read directly, for the one thing `sprites` cannot
-- answer: which archive member a graphics-id NAME belongs to. Section 5 below
-- is what makes that impossible to miss again -- this list says "written and
-- unread", and section 5 checks the unread half rather than assuming it.
--
-- The check cannot tell a legitimate dump from a stranded table -- that takes
-- a person. What it can do is make the list impossible to grow quietly, which
-- is the only thing that would have caught the move animations.
