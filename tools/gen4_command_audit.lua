-- tools/gen4_command_audit.lua -- run every Gen 4 script command against the
-- REAL cache and check that it runs and writes what it promises.
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS. Eight chapters of lowering were written by reading pret and
-- the port side by side, which catches the wrong kind of mistake. Reading finds
-- a misunderstood cartridge rule; it does not find a Lua scoping error or a
-- field spelled two ways. This found both on its first run:
--
--   * `itemKey` referenced ABOVE its `local function` line, so `g4_buffer`
--     raised "attempt to call a nil value (global 'itemKey')" every time a TM's
--     move name was wanted.
--   * `g4_pc_free_slots` answering ZERO free boxes when it could not load the
--     Boxes module -- which is not "unknown", it is "your boxes are full", the
--     one answer that locks a player out of the Great Marsh.
--
-- AND IT HAD TO BE TAUGHT TO SEE A PASS. The first run reported 25 commands as
-- "NO VAR WRITTEN" because it looked in `save.vars`; the port keeps script vars
-- in `save.gen4Vars`. A harness that cannot observe a success condemns
-- everything, which is the same class of error as one that cannot observe a
-- failure -- so it now asserts it can watch a var being written before it
-- trusts a single result.

--
-- Run:  texlua tools/gen4_command_audit.lua [path to a platinum data/generated]
--
-- IT FINDS ITS OWN CHECKOUT, and that is not tidiness.  This used to carry
-- three absolute paths from the machine it was written on, and the FIRST of
-- them was an overlay directory holding a stale copy of `Gen4Commands` -- so
-- the audit silently graded a module that was months out of date, reported
-- "43 checks, 0 failures", and could not run at all on anybody else's
-- checkout.  A harness that cannot observe the thing it grades is the failure
-- this file already has a canary for; this is the same fault one level up.
