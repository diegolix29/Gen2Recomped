--
-- THE FAULT THIS EXISTS FOR WAS NOT COSMETIC. The Gen 4 PartyMenu alias did
-- not list `tmhm`, so BagMenu's push was declined; `Screens.resolveId` then
-- returned the GAME BOY id, because a Platinum cache is not a Hoenn one; and
-- whichever screen served it called ItemEffects.use, which scans
-- `speciesDef.tmhm` with a bare `ipairs`. A Gen 4 cache had no such list.
-- USING A TM RAISED.
--
-- So there are three separate things to check and they fail in three different
-- ways: the ALIAS (wrong screen), the LIST (a crash), and the WORDS (the right
-- screen saying Emerald's "NOT ABLE" where Platinum says "UNABLE!").
--
-- Run:  texlua tools/gen4_party_check.lua [cache dir]
--
-- Without a cache only the port's own constants are checked, and it SAYS so.
