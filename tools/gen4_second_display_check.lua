-- WHAT THIS PROVES: that `display` mode -- the bottom screen on a REAL second
-- panel, the AYN Thor's lower screen -- draws to its own surface instead of into
-- the window, that a window click can never be mistaken for a tap on it, that a
-- tap that really did come from the panel still reaches the same handlers as
-- before, and that the whole mode disappears cleanly on a machine with one
-- screen instead of leaving the player with no bottom screen at all.
--
-- THE TRAPS THIS FILE EXISTS TO PIN DOWN, all three of them shapes that have
-- already bitten this module once:
--
--  1. A MODE THAT DEGRADES TO NOTHING.  Saves are portable.  If `display`
--     answered "off" on a desktop -- and "off" is every caller's cue to draw
--     nothing -- a save made on the handheld would open on a PC with no bottom
--     screen anywhere and no obvious way to get it back.  Section 2 requires the
--     fallback to be `swap`, and requires the STORED setting to survive it.
--
--  2. THE HIT TEST AND THE DRAW DISAGREEING ABOUT WHERE THE SURFACE IS.  That
--     is pass 137's bug exactly, and `display` is the one mode where the honest
--     answer flips: the picture is NOT in the window, so `toLocal` must refuse
--     every window point -- otherwise the top-left 256x192 of the field doubles
--     as the battle menu.  Section 3 sweeps the window and requires a total
--     refusal, with `swap` swept in the same run as the control that proves the
--     sweep can pass.
--
--  3. A MID-FRAME CANVAS BIND THAT DOES NOT PUT THE FRAME BACK.  `draw` runs
--     inside somebody else's render pass.  Leaving the canvas, the scissor or
--     the transform changed corrupts everything drawn afterwards, and the damage
--     shows up somewhere else entirely.  Section 4 records every graphics call
--     and requires the state to come back.
