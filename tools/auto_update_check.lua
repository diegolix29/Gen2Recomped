-- THE SELF-UPDATER, GRADED WHERE IT ACTUALLY BREAKS.
--
-- Three platforms sent the player to the GitHub releases page by hand, for
-- three different reasons, and not one of them printed anything:
--
--   Android   src/update/check_worker.lua posted `needs_full` for every
--             bridge-transport build, which is every Android build.  A POLICY
--             REFUSAL, not a failure -- so there was nothing to find in a log.
--   Switch    no HTTPS client reachable from Lua, so the check died at
--             "no network transport" with status "error" -- and the launcher
--             banner draws nothing for "error", so the player saw no updater.
--   Xbox      the same, plus a notify-only gate that could not fire: it keyed
--             on `_G.POKEPORT_NOTIFY_ONLY_UPDATES`, which occurs exactly once
--             in the repository (the read) and is set by nothing.
--
-- WHAT THIS GRADES, and each section is built so it can fail:
--
--   1. ONE FACT for where a payload lives.  The download destination and the
--      path Boot.run mounts were seven string literals in three files.  This
--      scans src/update with comments stripped and fails on a second spelling.
--   2. THE CAPABILITY RULE, driven with stub hosts.  io.popen is replaced for
--      the duration, so "the Switch must not reach io.popen at all" is an
--      assertion about a call that was counted, not a claim about a comment.
--   3. The semver comparison, including the measured pair that matters: the
--      working tree's 0.7.6 against the live release 0.8.3.
--   4. The sums parsing, in the format `sha256sum` emits and release.yml runs.
--   5. The minShell refusal -- `>` not `>=`, and a too-new payload KEPT.
--   6. That the state the notify-only leg posts is one the launcher banner
--      actually draws.  "Those builds CHECK and REPORT" was in a comment for
--      two years while the banner rendered nothing for the state they posted.
--
-- No cartridge and no cache: every assertion here runs on the tree alone.
--
-- Run:  texlua tools/auto_update_check.lua

-- EVERY FILE THIS CHECK READS IS A COMMITTED REPO FILE, so "not present" is a
-- BROKEN TREE and not a missing optional input.
--
-- Four blocks here used to open with `if not read(path) then io.write("(... not
-- present -- skipped)") else ... end`, and that is the fault shape 5 of
-- claude/check_design_lessons.md names: without `ports/` the run lost **ten**
-- assertions, printed a parenthetical nobody greps for, and reported a plain
-- `PASS`.  The one assertion standing between the Switch's 404 and its return
-- vanished silently, and the suite line was indistinguishable from a full run.
--
-- AND `PASS*` WAS NEVER AVAILABLE FOR IT.  tools/run_checks.py sets that marker
-- at its own lines 255-259 from `reduced`, which it populates at line 247 only
-- when an OPTIONAL ARGUMENT SLOT declared in a check's `Run:` line was not
-- supplied.  It never reads the check's output, and this check declares no
-- argument slots at all, so `reduced` is permanently empty here.  A check
-- cannot ask to be marked reduced; it can only fail.
--
-- So: fail, naming the path.  `git ls-files` confirms all four are tracked and
-- `git check-ignore` that none is ignored, which is what makes absence a fault
-- rather than a condition.  The dependent block is then skipped so the run
-- produces ONE diagnosable failure instead of ten cascades against nil.
