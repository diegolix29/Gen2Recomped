-- PER-GENERATION SETTINGS.
--
-- Asked for alongside the per-generation mod switches: "also allow users to
-- pick per generation settings as well".  The same reasoning applies.  COLORS
-- is the clearest case -- DMG green is the right answer for Red and an
-- obviously wrong one for Emerald -- but FAITHFUL RES, GBC FX and the frame
-- cap all mean different things on a Game Boy screen and a GBA one, and until
-- this there was one value for all three and no way to say otherwise.
--
-- THE SHAPE ON DISK IS ADDITIVE, exactly like ModGens:
--
--   options.<key>                        -- the shared value, unchanged
--   options.perGeneration[g][key]        -- what generation g uses instead
--
-- An absent generation, or an absent key inside one, falls through to the
-- shared value.  So a build that has never seen an override reads and writes
-- what it always did, and an older build handed a file with overrides in it
-- ignores a table it does not know about and keeps playing.  Nothing migrates
-- in either direction.
--
-- OVERRIDES ARE STORED, NOT FLATTENED.  Clearing one has to give the shared
-- value back, which means the shared value has to still be there -- so
-- `resolve` copies rather than edits, and `fold` (the write direction, used
-- when a game that was loaded under an override saves its options again) puts
-- a changed value back into the override it came from instead of leaking it
-- into the shared one.
--
-- SOME KEYS ARE NEVER PER-GENERATION.  The options file is also where the mod
-- enable-state, the save-slot registry and the launcher's own settings live.
-- Those describe the installation, not a playthrough, and a generation-scoped
-- copy of the mod list is a way to lose a mod list.  SHARED_ONLY names them,
-- and it is a deny-list rather than an allow-list so that a key added later
-- is per-generation-able by default -- the failure mode of forgetting to add
-- a new option here is that it becomes settable per generation, which is
-- recoverable, rather than that it silently stops being.
