-- Only the top state updates, and only the top state reads input.  So a state
-- that is pushed and never popped does not look like a bug in the state stack
-- -- it looks like the game has died: nothing walks, no menu opens, no button
-- does anything, and there is no error, because nothing went wrong.  Reported
-- twice from play as "no input is working at all ... i cant look around walk
-- or open any menus", and both times the only way to find out what was sitting
-- there was to add printing and reproduce it.
--
-- A state is an anonymous table, so it has no name to print.  What it does
-- have is functions, and a function knows which file it was written in -- so
-- the label is the source of its `update` (or `draw`, or `enter`), which is
-- exactly the file somebody would have to open next anyway.

-- child in `enter`, so their `update` never ran once, and both were silently
-- frozen: the clouds stood still, and Birch -- loaded, positioned, correct --
-- was drawn at alpha zero for the entire introduction.
--
-- So a covered state gets `animate`, and only `animate`. It is a separate
-- name rather than a flag on `update` because the contract is different and
-- has to be: animate MOVES PICTURES. It must not read input (the title's
-- update opens the menu on A, and running that under the menu would open a
-- second one on the same press) and it must not push, pop or finish. A state
-- that wants both puts the motion in animate and calls it from update.
