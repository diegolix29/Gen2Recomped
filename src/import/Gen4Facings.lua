-- WHICH PICTURE IS THE ONE FACING SOUTH.
--
-- An overworld sheet out of mmodel.narc is a stack of textures in the
-- archive's own order, and that order is NOT "stand down, stand up, stand
-- left, walk down, ...".  The engine's SpriteRenderer has read every sheet in
-- every earlier generation with those six fixed slots, so a Platinum sheet
-- read the same way puts a BACK view where the standing south frame belongs
-- and a LEFT view where the southward step belongs.  The symptom on screen is
-- precise and was reported as such: the character spins in circles as it
-- walks.
--
-- THE ORDER IS IN THE CARTRIDGE, in the same archive as the sheets.  The last
-- twenty-five members of mmodel.narc are not models at all: they are the
-- BillboardGfxSequence tables, and each one says which texture is showing on
-- each frame of that sprite's animation.  The layout is four fields back to
-- back, exactly as billboard_gfx_sequence.c reads it:
--
--     u32  seqCount
--     u16  startFrame[seqCount]     the animation frame each segment begins on
--     u8   textureIdx[seqCount]     the texture shown from that frame
--     u8   plttIdx[seqCount]        and the palette
--
-- and a frame's texture is the last segment whose startFrame is <= it.
--
-- THE FRAMES ARE GROUPED INTO ANIMATIONS BY A SECOND TABLE, which is code
-- rather than data (object_event_gfx_data.c): a walker's animation N covers
-- frames 16N to 16N+15, and the direction picks N through { 0, 1, 2, 3 } for
-- a walk.  Directions are NORTH, SOUTH, WEST, EAST -- constants/map_object.h
-- -- so the sixteen frames of each animation are four segments of four, and
-- the four segments are that direction's cycle.
--
-- A CYCLE IS stand, step, stand, step.  The two steps are REAL art here: a
-- Platinum sheet carries an east side as well as a west one, so nothing is
-- mirrored and nothing is faked, which is the one place this differs from
-- every earlier generation the renderer serves.
--
-- WHAT THIS REFUSES TO DO IS GUESS.  A member is accepted as a sequence only
-- when its four fields account for its length exactly, its startFrames begin
-- at zero and ascend, and its texture indices stay inside the sheet they are
-- read against.  A sheet is given a cycle table only when the segments divide
-- evenly into four directions.  Anything else is reported, not approximated:
-- a sprite with no cycle table keeps the renderer's classic six slots, which
-- is what it had before this module existed.
