-- Gen 4 geometry, in the shape the engine can actually load.
--
-- `Gen4Nsbmd` produces a model as Lua tables -- one table per vertex, one per
-- triangle.  That is the right shape to CHECK (it is what the corpus test
-- reads) and the wrong shape to ship: the briefcase alone is 2,430 vertex
-- tables and 1,644 triangle tables, and written as Lua source that is a
-- megabyte of `{ x = ..., y = ... }` for one model out of six.
--
-- So a packed model is two BINARY STRINGS, which is the same trick the map
-- grids already use (`def.blocks` is a 2 KB string, not 1,024 tables).
--
-- THE PRECISION IS THE CARTRIDGE'S OWN, which is what makes this lossless
-- rather than a compromise.  A Gen 4 coordinate is fx16 -- a signed 16-bit
-- number over 4096 -- so storing the raw fixed-point value keeps every
-- position exactly as the display list gave it.  Texture coordinates are in
-- sixteenths of a texel and are likewise integers already.  Nothing here
-- rounds anything that was not already round.
--
--   vertex  16 bytes  x, y, z, u, v as s16; r, g, b as u8; nx, ny, nz as s8
--   index    2 bytes  u16 into this shape's own vertex array
--
-- THE NORMAL IS NOT OPTIONAL, AND LEAVING IT OUT COST THE WHOLE OF SINNOH'S
-- LIGHTING.
--
-- This used to be fourteen bytes with a pad byte on the end, and the pad was
-- justified as making a vertex an even number of bytes.  It still is even; it
-- now carries the three axes of the normal instead of nothing, and that is the
-- difference between a lit world and a flat one.
--
-- Platinum's map display lists issue NORMAL (0x21) and NOT COLOR (0x20),
-- because the DS's geometry engine computes each vertex's colour in hardware
-- from the normal and the area light.  `Gen4Nsbmd` decodes those normals
-- correctly and puts them on every vertex table.  THIS FILE THEN THREW THEM
-- AWAY, one step before the only consumer that wants them -- so every vertex
-- in the cache kept the decoder's white default and every polygon in Sinnoh
-- drew at full brightness with no directional term.  Measured over Route 201's
-- chunk 5, Twinleaf's chunk 0 and the `t1_h01` house: 4,794 vertices, ONE
-- distinct colour between them, 255,255,255.
--
-- The normal is stored as three signed bytes rather than the cartridge's
-- 10 bits per axis.  That is 1/127 of precision on a unit vector, which is
-- four times coarser than the source and about two hundred times finer than
-- anything a diffuse term does with it; it keeps the vertex even, and it keeps
-- the side-car under 21 MB.
--
-- IT IS NOT BAKED INTO THE COLOUR HERE, deliberately.  The light is per MAP
-- and the geometry is SHARED -- one buildings set of 590 models serves every
-- town, and one terrain chunk is drawn by every map that reaches it (Route
-- 201's own log shows chunk 5 baked by six ground instances at once).  Baking
-- one map's light into shared geometry gives every other reader the wrong one,
-- so the normal travels and `src/render/Gen4Shade.lua` lights it where the map
-- -- and therefore the member and the time band -- is known.
