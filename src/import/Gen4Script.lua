-- Gen 4 (Platinum) script decoding: bytes to instructions.
--
-- Gen4ScriptOps says how wide every command is.  This walks a real script
-- file with that table and produces instructions -- opcode, name, operand
-- values, and for a jump the absolute target rather than the relative offset
-- the cartridge stores.  Lowering to engine commands comes after this and
-- needs it; nothing here decides what a command MEANS.
--
-- A MEMBER IS NOT A SCRIPT.  /fielddata/script/scr_seq.narc's 1,124 members
-- each hold SEVERAL scripts behind a header of u32 offsets, and the offsets
-- are RELATIVE -- to the position after the offset word, not to the start of
-- the file.  The header ends either at the halfword 0xFD13 or, more often,
-- simply where the first script begins: there is no count.  So the walk stops
-- when the cursor reaches the lowest target it has seen, which is the only
-- rule that works for both shapes.  Reading a count that is not there takes
-- the first script's opcodes as more offsets.
--
-- JUMPS ARE SIGNED AND RELATIVE TO THE END OF THE INSTRUCTION.  `goto` and
-- `call` store a four-byte offset measured from the byte AFTER it -- so the
-- target is (position of the operand) + 4 + offset, and the offset is
-- negative for every backward jump, which is most loops.  Reading it unsigned
-- sends a loop several gigabytes forward and the decode simply stops, which
-- looks like a short script rather than a misread operand.
--
-- WHAT THIS REFUSES TO DO.  Nine commands have no fixed width (see
-- Gen4ScriptOps.VARIABLE_LENGTH).  Reaching one ends the walk with
-- `stopped = "variable"` rather than a guessed skip: a guessed width here is
-- the Sootopolis bug Gen3ScriptOps' header describes, where a two-byte slip
-- lands on a plausible opcode and the decode sails on producing valid-looking
-- nonsense.  Eight scripts in the cartridge end this way.
--
-- HOW THE JUMP FORMULA WAS CHECKED, since a decoder that reads its own output
-- can agree with itself all day.  Starting at every entry point and following
-- every `goto` and `call` TRANSITIVELY reaches 8,567 basic blocks and 78,093
-- instructions -- twice what a linear walk from the entry points alone sees --
-- and of the 15,002 jump operands in them, ZERO point outside their own
-- member.  8,549 of those blocks then decode to a clean `end`.
--
-- That tests two things at once.  A wrong sign or a wrong base would scatter
-- targets to negative numbers and gigabyte offsets, and a wrong operand width
-- anywhere earlier in an instruction would shift the jump operand itself and
-- produce the same mess.  Neither happens.  Four blocks of the 8,567 stop on
-- something unexpected -- two run off the end and two reach an opcode not in
-- the table -- which is 0.05% and is recorded rather than smoothed over.
--
-- MEASURED COVERAGE, which is what makes lowering plannable: 4,079 scripts,
-- 50,835 instructions, 381 distinct opcodes.  The commonest 20 opcodes are
-- 87% of all instructions and fully cover 58% of scripts; the commonest 80
-- are 98.3% and fully cover 89%.  The top of that list is the shape of a
-- conversation -- lockall, faceplayer, message, closemessage, releaseall --
-- so a lowering that starts there gets NPCs talking before it gets anything
-- else working.
