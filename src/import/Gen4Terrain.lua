-- SINNOH'S GROUND, in the shape the engine can draw it.
--
-- Platinum has no tileset.  Its world is 666 land chunks, each 32 x 32 tiles
-- of 16 world units -- a 512-unit square -- carrying an NSBMD mesh, a BDHC
-- height field and a 2,048-byte permission grid.  A map is a MATRIX of those
-- chunks, and every map in the game is one matrix.
--
-- Until now the engine drew `TILESET_GEN4_STANDIN` over all of it: one flat
-- colour per terrain class, which is a legible plan of a map and is not
-- Sinnoh.  This is the stage that puts the cartridge's own ground in the
-- cache.
--
-- WHAT IS MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED, because every one of these was got
-- wrong once first:
--
--   * A CHUNK'S LOCAL ORIGIN IS ITS CENTRE.  `posScale` is 32 and a chunk's
--     vertices run about -8..+8, so world units are `value * posScale` and the
--     chunk spans -256..+256 of its 512-unit square.  Read as 0..512, seven
--     eighths of the mesh falls off the edge -- 236 triangles of 2,667 landed
--     before this was found, which looks like a broken decoder and is
--     arithmetic.
--   * ALL 666 CHUNKS CARRY BOTH A MESH AND A BDHC.  Neither is optional.
--   * A CHUNK'S MESH CARRIES NO TEXTURES.  It names them; the pictures are in
--     `map_tex_set.narc`, chosen by the MAP's area record, and a chunk shared
--     between two maps is textured by whichever map the player is standing in.
--
-- THE GEOMETRY GOES IN A SIDE-CAR BINARY, not in a Lua table.  Packed, the 666
-- chunks are 17.7 MB; as escaped Lua source that is nearer 50 MB and the cache
-- would take minutes to load.  `CacheFs.write` takes raw bytes -- it is what
-- every PNG already goes through -- so the chunks are one file and the Lua
-- module is an index of offsets into it.

-- The texture sets
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- ONE PICTURE PER TEXTURE, and an atlas was tried first.
--
-- A map texture is TILED across the faces it dresses: a chunk's UVs run from
-- about -196 to +228 texels on a 64-texel picture, which is the same grass
-- laid down seven times over. That needs a sampler set to repeat, and a
-- sub-rectangle of an atlas cannot repeat -- the wrap applies to the whole
-- sheet, so every tiled face would smear its neighbours across itself.
--
-- Packing them and cropping back out at run time would work and buys nothing:
-- the pictures are 16 to 128 pixels square, `Gen4Model.new` already loads a
-- shape's texture by path and already sets `repeat` on it, and the cost of the
-- honest version is a file count rather than a code path. So each texture is
-- its own PNG and the index names it.
--
-- WHICH PALETTE EACH TEXTURE WEARS -- and it was palette 1, for all of them.
--
-- The note that used to sit here said: "Against the FIRST palette: a texture's
-- own palette is named by the MATERIAL that wears it, which is a fact about
-- the chunk rather than about the picture, and the great majority of these
-- sets pair one palette with one texture anyway."  The first half is true.
-- The second half is false, and it painted Sinnoh one colour.
--
-- Reported from play: "much of the tileset didnt seem properly colored
-- especially when outside".  Set 6, which is Twinleaf Town's, holds 78
-- textures and SEVENTY-FOUR palettes.  `ngrass` -- grass -- came out in
-- browns, because palette 1 of that set is `apeak`, a mountain top.  Every
-- outdoor map in the game was wearing one palette.
--
-- THE JOIN IS ALREADY IN THE CACHE and always was: every chunk shape carries
-- `material`, `texture` AND `palette`, because `Gen4Nsbmd` reads the material
-- that names both.  `ngrass` is worn with palette `grass`.  Nothing used it.
--
-- AND NAME-MATCHING IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE, which is worth saying because it is
-- the obvious shortcut.  Counted over all 7,547 chunk shapes: of the 1,149
-- distinct texture names, **553 are worn with a palette of a different name**
-- -- `ngrass02` wears `grass02`, `bf_symbol2` wears `symbol`, `ginga2` wears
-- `dun26_092`, and a further 553 follow a `_pl` suffix convention that the
-- other half does not.  Across the archives as a whole, 1,293 of 3,130 map
-- textures and 2,104 of 3,063 building textures have no palette of their own
-- name at all.
--
-- TWENTY-NINE textures are worn with MORE THAN ONE palette (`wcliff` is
-- `criff` on 76 shapes and `wcriff` on 7).  Those get a second picture filed
-- under "<texture>#<palette>"; every other texture is filed once under its
-- own name, so the file count barely moves.
--
-- `pairing` is { [textureName] = { [paletteName] = uses } }, gathered from the
-- chunks -- which are extracted before this runs, so there is nothing to
-- reorder.  Without it this falls back to a same-name palette and then to
-- position, which is better than palette 1 and is still not the answer.
