-- Species battle pictures: pl_pokegra.narc, and the placement bytes beside it.
--
-- WHAT THE ARCHIVE IS.  2,964 members = 494 species slots of SIX, and the six
-- are in the order pokeplatinum's own packer writes them
-- (tools/scripts/make_pl_pokegra.py, `for face in back, front / for gender in
-- female, male`):
--
--   +0 back female   +1 back male   +2 front female   +3 front male
--   +4 normal palette (NCLR)        +5 shiny palette (NCLR)
--
-- Positional, with no name table -- pl_pokegra has no `.order` file that
-- Gen4Archives could match -- so the order above is the only thing saying
-- which member is which, and it comes from the packer rather than from a
-- guess at the pattern.
--
-- THE FEMALE-ONLY TRAP, which costs sixteen species outright.  The obvious
-- read is "the male sheet is the sprite, the female sheet is the optional
-- variant".  For a female-only species the MALE SLOT IS EMPTY and the art is
-- in the female one.  Reading only +3 leaves Nidoran-f, Nidorina, Nidoqueen,
-- Chansey, Kangaskhan, Jynx, Smoochum, Miltank, Blissey, Illumise, Latias,
-- Wormadam, Vespiquen, Happiny, Froslass and Cresselia with NO PICTURE AT
-- ALL -- and not as an error, because an empty member is a legal member.
-- `Gen4Pokegra.sheet` falls back, and reports which slot it used.
--
-- THE DATA IS ENCRYPTED AND NOT TILED.  Every sheet is 20x10 "tiles" at 4bpp,
-- but the NCGR's layout flag says LINEAR BITMAP: the pixels are rows of the
-- picture, not 8x8 cells in reading order.  Reading it as tiles produces a
-- picture -- the right pixels in 8x8 blocks shuffled across the frame, which
-- looks like a palette bug rather than a layout one.  Gen4Graphics.tiles
-- already reports `bitmap`; the pixels still have to go through
-- Gen4Graphics.decryptSprite first.
--
-- 20x10 tiles is 160x80, which is TWO 80x80 FRAMES SIDE BY SIDE.  Measured
-- across the 477 species with a front sheet: 475 have two genuinely different
-- frames, 2 are identical and 2 have an empty second frame. So it is a real
-- two-frame animation, and -- this is the useful part -- a horizontal
-- two-frame strip is ALREADY the shape `picAnim` reads. Nothing is restacked.
