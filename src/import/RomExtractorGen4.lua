-- The Gen 4 (Platinum) extractor: cartridge in, cache out.
--
-- Eleven modules under src/import read Platinum correctly and none of them
-- writes anything.  This is the stage runner that puts them in order and
-- lands their output in data/generated, which is what CacheFs.mountVersion
-- serves to a running game.
--
-- IT TAKES A PATH, NOT THE ROM'S BYTES, and that is the one place it refuses
-- to look like RomExtractorGen2 and RomExtractorGen3.  Those are handed the
-- whole cartridge as a Lua string because a Game Boy ROM is at most 32 MiB
-- and every stage wants a different part of it.  Platinum is 128 MiB, the
-- engine has to run alongside it on a phone, and almost every stage wants ONE
-- FILE out of a filesystem.  NdsRom reads ranges on demand from an open
-- handle; handing it a 128 MiB string instead would undo that before the
-- first stage ran.
--
-- The consequence is that RomImporter's `startData` path cannot drive this as
-- it drives the others: it reads the file into memory and hashes the string.
-- Verification still needs the bytes, but extraction must not, so an import
-- that reaches this point has to pass the path along.  That is a real seam
-- and it is not built yet -- see the note at the bottom of this file.
--
-- WHAT EACH STAGE WRITES, and why the shape is what it is: every table is
-- keyed the way the engine already expects for Gen 1-3, because
-- Commands.resolve, the party screens and the Pokedex are
-- generation-agnostic and a fourth spelling of "species" would be a fourth
-- set of branches in code that currently has none.

-- SINNOH'S OVERWORLD IS ONE GRID, AND A MAP IS A WINDOW ONTO IT.
--
-- 84 headers name matrix 0, the 960x960 overworld, and each takes a rectangle
-- out of it.  There are no warps between them: the player walks from Twinleaf
-- Town to Route 201 and the header simply changes underfoot.  Nothing in this
-- port knew that, so the edge of every outdoor map was a cliff into terrain
-- the renderer draws and nobody owns -- reported as "im able to walk outside
-- of the boundaries still", and, once the boundary was sealed, as a town with
-- no way out.
--
-- THE ENGINE ALREADY HAS THE MACHINERY.  Gen 1-3 maps connect at their edges
-- and `OverworldState:checkEdgeExit` walks the player across a seam without a
-- warp, reading the neighbour's own collision as it goes.  A connection is
-- `{ map, offset }` where `offset` is how far the neighbour is shifted ALONG
-- the seam, and the landing is `destX = cellX - offset` (`connectionLanding`).
-- For two windows onto the same grid that offset is exactly the difference of
-- their origins, which is what makes this a derivation rather than a guess:
--
--     up / down    offset = destOriginX - originX
--     left / right offset = destOriginY - originY
--
-- ADJACENCY IS TESTED, NOT ASSUMED.  `connectionLanding` puts an upward step
-- on the destination's BOTTOM row, which is only right when the destination's
-- bottom edge IS this map's top edge; two regions that overlap or sit corner
-- to corner get no connection rather than a wrong one.  `connectionFor`
-- already narrows a multi-neighbour edge to the one covering the player's
-- position along it, using the same origin arithmetic, so a long route with
-- three maps along its side needs nothing extra here.
--
-- Measured over this cartridge: 40 layouts are shared, 69 maps come out with
-- at least one connection and there are 140 edges between them.  Twinleaf Town
-- gets `up -> Route 201` at offset 0; Route 201 gets Twinleaf below it,
-- Verity Lakefront to the west at -32 and Sandgem Town to the east; Jubilife
-- City gets Routes 203, 218, 202 and 204.  That is Sinnoh.

-- The join: which script each map's objects and signs run.
--
-- A map header names a scr_seq member (`scripts`) and an events archive
-- (`events`); an object event carries a SCRIPT ID, which indexes that
-- member's entry-point list.  Nothing else connects the two, which is why
-- this stage exists at all and why it has to run after both.
--
-- MAP IDS ARE THE CARTRIDGE'S OWN INTERNAL NAMES -- "C01", "C05GYM0113",
-- "D25R0106" -- from mapname.bin, keyed by header id.  They are unique, they
-- are stable across revisions, and they are what a log line should say.  The
-- player-facing name is a different table (message bank 433) and several maps
-- share one, so it would not do as a key.
--
-- NOT EVERY SCRIPT ID IS A SCRIPT, and getting this wrong makes a working
-- link look broken.  Counting anything that did not resolve as "missing"
-- reported 2,350 failures against 1,887 successes -- more misses than hits,
-- which should never be believed without checking what the misses are.
-- Classified instead:
--
--   0                       no script
--   1 .. 1999               an entry in THIS MAP's own script member, at
--                           index id - 1
--   >= 2000                 an entry in a SHARED script file, chosen by the
--                           highest threshold the id clears
--   65535                   the "no script" sentinel, which is not a band
--
-- The bands are in Gen4ScriptBands, taken from the cartridge's own dispatcher
-- rather than guessed, and they are no longer recorded as `special`: an id in
-- a band is an ordinary entry point in a shared file, and 1,885 of the 1,920
-- land inside the file their band names.
--
-- TWO BUGS FIXED HERE AT ONCE, and the second hid behind the first.
--
--   * `specials` was keyed by an object's localId AND by a sign's index in the
--     same table, so a sign with index 1 silently replaced the object with
--     localId 1.  228 of 2,148 entries -- better than one in ten -- were being
--     overwritten, and nothing counted them because the count was taken before
--     the write.  Objects and signs now have a table each.
--   * Nothing looked at what the ids meant, so nothing noticed that the events
--     running berry-tree scripts were being drawn as Team Galactic's Mars.
--     Classifying them is what exposed the graphics indirection in
--     Gen4ObjectGfx.

-- execute, because the pool had no way to say which block a band id names.
--

--
--   * WHICH MEMBER a band's file is.  `Gen4Archives.names` carries scr_seq's
--     1,124 member names, so `scripts_common` resolves to member 211 --
--     derived rather than written down, which is what keeps it right if the
--     archive is ever re-ordered.
--   * WHICH BLOCK an id names.  `extractScripts` already walks every member
--     and records its ENTRY POINTS in order; a band id is an index into that
--     list, exactly as a map's own script id is.  Only the band members' lists
--     are written here -- thirty of the 1,124 -- so this costs nothing.
--   * WHICH TEXT BANK it reads.  `Gen4ScriptBands.TEXT_BANK`, transcribed from
--     the same dispatcher table the thresholds came from.  A common script's
--     `message 3` is entry 3 of bank 213 and has nothing to do with the town

  -- ...AND WHICH SPECIES CAN LEARN WHICH OF THEM, which is the half that was
  -- missing and the reason a TM could not be used in Sinnoh at all.
  --
  -- `def.tmhm` -- a plain list of move ids -- is what ItemEffects.use scans
  -- when a machine is used, what DayCare reads for egg moves, and what a party
  -- screen asks to print ABLE or UNABLE beside a member.  On a Gen 1-3 cache
  -- the extractor writes it directly; ON A GEN 4 CACHE IT WAS NEVER WRITTEN AT
  -- ALL, and ItemEffects scans it with a bare `ipairs(speciesDef.tmhm)`, so
  -- teaching a TM on Platinum did not merely look wrong -- IT RAISED.
  --
  -- The cartridge does not store a list. It stores a 128-BIT MASK, four u32 on
  -- every personal record, and CanPokemonFormLearnTM turns a machine id into
  -- (word, bit) with `tmID < 32 -> mask 1, 1 << tmID`, then 32/64/96. So bit b
  -- of word w is machine w * 32 + b, ZERO-BASED, in the same TM01..TM92,
  -- HM01..HM08 order sTMHMMoves is in -- which is what makes the pairing one
  -- index and not a join.
  --
  -- TWO THINGS SAY THE BIT ORDER IS RIGHT, and neither is the arithmetic:
  --   * 100 machines live in 128 bits, so 28 bits are spare. Measured over all
  --     493 species: the highest bit set anywhere is 99 and NOTHING is set at
  --     or above 100. A wrong word order or a flipped bit order would scatter
  --     set bits into that empty tail.
  --   * MAGIKARP AND DITTO COME OUT WITH EXACTLY ZERO. They are the two
  --     species in the game that learn no machine at all, and "exactly none"
  --     is a result a wrong reading does not produce -- it produces a
  --     plausible handful. Bulbasaur comes out with 28, ending HM01 Cut,
  --     HM04 Strength, HM06 Rock Smash; Pikachu with 32, including TM24
  --     Thunderbolt, TM25 Thunder and TM73 Thunder Wave.

-- `screens.newGame = false` is not decoration: Game.lua reads that key and, if
-- it is NIL rather than false, pushes "OakSpeech" for any non-Gen-2 version.
-- Platinum's opening is Rowan's, not Oak's, and neither is built -- so the

-- 3D models
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- WHICH ARCHIVES' MODELS ARE PUBLISHED, and why this is a list rather than
-- "all of them".
--
-- The cartridge holds 1,030 models and the whole lot packs to under 4 MB, so
-- size is not the reason.  The reason is that a model in the cache is only
-- worth having when something draws it, and exactly one screen does so far.
-- Publishing the other twenty archives now would put twenty archives' worth of
-- geometry in every player's cache to be read by nothing, and would make the
-- import slower for no one's benefit.  Each entry moves here when the screen
-- that needs it exists.
-- SINNOH'S GROUND, in the cache.
--
-- Everything this stage needs was already read and none of it was ever kept:
-- the 666 land chunks decode, pack and verify with no failures, the 74 map
-- texture sets decode every one of their 3,130 textures, and a map's own
-- header says which set it wears.  What was missing was somewhere to put them.
--
-- THE GEOMETRY IS A SIDE-CAR BINARY and the Lua module is an index of offsets
-- into it -- see Gen4Terrain for why 17.7 MB cannot be a Lua table -- and the
-- heights are a second one beside it, 301 KB of BDHC left in the cartridge's
-- own form because Gen4Bdhc reads it as it stands.
--
-- WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO is bake a picture.  A chunk is drawn top-down into a
-- canvas at run time, once, the same way Gen3Tiles bakes its metatile sheets --
-- so the cache carries the mesh and the textures, not 666 rendered images that
-- would have to be re-rendered anyway the first time the camera changed.

-- stage has existed and `build_model.narc` is extracted beside them.
--
-- WHAT WAS MISSING IS THE INDIRECTION IN THE MIDDLE, AND IT IS NOT OPTIONAL.

--         mapPropModelFiles[id] = NARC read of build_model.narc[id];
--     }
--
-- so each area loads a SUBSET of `build_model.narc`, the ids are GLOBAL members
-- of that archive, and `mapPropModelFiles` is sparse -- indexed by the global id,
-- not by position in the list.
--

--         return &mapPropModelFiles[0];
--     }
--
-- with `map_prop.c` forcing `loadedProp->modelID = 0` alongside it, and
-- `AreaDataManager_Load` guaranteeing member 0 is resident whatever else is. That
-- member is `dmybox00` -- confirmed by reading it: build_model.narc member 0 is
-- 1900 bytes of NSBMD and the string "dmybox" is inside it. **The placeholder art
-- in the report is this model.** Any prop the port cannot resolve is not a
-- missing sign, it is a visible grey box, which is exactly what was seen.
--
-- `Gen4Maps.areaBuildings` HAS DECODED THIS LIST CORRECTLY THE WHOLE TIME AND
-- NOTHING EVER CALLED IT. All 71 members decode on the count-then-ids shape with
-- none refused, the largest list is 138 against the cartridge's 768 assert, and
-- the 527 distinct ids top out at 589 against a 590-member archive. A decoder
-- with no caller is the same failure as a table with no reader, one step earlier.
--
-- THE ASSOCIATION IS MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED. Walking every map's matrix and
-- testing its chunks' prop ids against its own area's list: of the 204 matrices
-- that carry props, **201 are covered exactly**. Three are not, and matrix 0 is
-- the loudest -- 501 placements with 101 distinct ids outside every single area
-- list, which is what a matrix shared by maps from different areas looks like
-- when only one area's subset is resident. On the cartridge those props draw the
-- dummy box, so the three exceptions are the rule working, not the rule failing.
--
-- Keyed by the ARCHIVE MEMBER and not by map, for the same reason the area lights
-- are: 71 lists against 593 maps.

-- THE AREA LIGHTS, WHICH IS THE COLOUR OF THE WORLD AND WAS NOT BEING EXTRACTED.

-- Reported from play as the overworld "rendering everything as flat 2d", with a
-- Twinleaf shot beside the cartridge's. The geometry was only part of it: the
-- port's grass is a BRIGHT SATURATED GREEN and its path YELLOW, where the
-- cartridge's are a muted olive and a warm ORANGE-BROWN. Same textures. The
-- cartridge LIGHTS them and this port was drawing them unlit, and unlit textures
-- always come out brighter and flatter than lit ones.
--
-- THE INDEX WAS IN THE CACHE THE WHOLE TIME, UNREAD AND POINTING AT THE WRONG U16.
-- The terrain stage above has written a byte onto all 593 maps since it was first
-- written, straight off the area record beside `texture`, under the name
-- `lighting`. It was pret's `dummy04` -- the one field of `AreaDataFile` the
-- cartridge never reads -- and the real `areaLightArchiveID` sat in the next u16
-- under the name `flags`. Writing a field nobody reads is how that survives:
-- there was no consumer to be wrong, so nothing ever disagreed with it.
--
-- `Gen4Maps.areaData` now names both correctly and records how the ROM settled
-- it. The corrected index is what this stage keys on.
--
-- THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SIXTH WRITE-AND-NEVER-READ TABLE, after
-- gen4_species_sprites, gen4_move_anims, gen4_particles, gen4_overworld (which
-- was Dawn) and the terrain byte itself -- which had gone one worse than unread,
-- because an unread field is also an unchecked one and this one was the wrong
-- field entirely. It is written under the
-- `gen4_` prefix and listed in Data's GEN4_PREFIXED for exactly that reason, so
-- `tools/gen4_cache_wiring_check.lua` can see it.
--

  -- scrolls are what makes Platinum's water move, and a baked chunk is still by
  -- definition."  Close, and wrong about the mechanism -- which is the kind of
  -- wrong that sends the next person to rebake the terrain.
  --
  -- MEASURED against this cartridge: of the 95 animations in `bm_anime`,
  --
  --    68 name a BUILD MODEL, by the model's own name
  --     3 name a texture in the area building texture sets
  --     0 name any material, shape or texture of a LAND CHUNK
  --
  -- and the names say the same thing out loud once you read them: `door_op`,
  -- `pc_door_op`, `stair_pc_u01d`, `funsui` (a fountain), `machine_l02`,
  -- `treeeff01`.  They animate the PROPS STANDING ON the ground -- doors
  -- opening, fountains running, tree tops moving -- not the ground.  Some of
  -- those props are water (`l_lake`, `wfall`), which is why the water intuition
  -- was nearly right and its mechanism was not.
  --
  -- The two archives are separate, so the per-archive pairing above cannot see
  -- across them; this is the one cross-archive link, made here once so nothing
  -- at run time has to search 95 animations per building per frame.

-- NOT BUILT YET, and each is a seam rather than a detail:
--
--   * RomImporter has to hand this a PATH.  Its `startData` reads the whole
--     file to hash it, which is correct for verification and wrong to carry
--     into extraction at 128 MiB.
--   * A TEXT RENDERER.  The fonts and their widths are extracted now, but
--     nothing draws with them: there is no Gen 4 text box, no line breaking
--     and no colour choice per box.  That is engine work, not extraction.
--   * The sheets with no cell bank ANYWHERE in their archive -- window frames,
--     mail backgrounds, the fonts -- are still laid out at a stated width and
--     still flagged `provisionalLayout`.  Most of those are tilesets rather
--     than sprites, so a bank may not exist to find.
--   * WHAT SWITCHES A FORM.  The form pictures are all extracted now, but
--     nothing chooses between them: Castform still needs the weather, Cherrim
--     the sun, Rotom its appliance, Arceus the held plate, and Unown a letter
--     from its personality value.  That is battle and party logic rather than
--     extraction, and it is the reason `def.forms` is written but not yet read.
--   * The map meshes and the BDHC height blocks, for the same reason.
--   * A map DEFINITION per map -- the grid, the objects with their sprites
--     and positions -- so the overworld has something to load.  The script
--     pool now names every map and its objects' scripts, but nothing yet
--     builds the world those objects stand in.
