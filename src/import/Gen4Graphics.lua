-- Gen 4 (Platinum) graphics: Nitro containers, palettes, tiles, tilemaps and
-- the LZ77 the cartridge wraps most of them in.
--
-- Every later stage needs this, which is why it comes before maps and items.
-- A DS graphic is not a blob at an address the way a Gen 1-3 one is; it is a
-- small tagged container, and there are four of them that matter:
--
--   NCLR  "RLCN"  palette   -- section TTLP, BGR555 colours
--   NCGR  "RGCN"  tiles     -- section RAHC, 8x8 tiles, 4bpp or 8bpp
--   NSCR  "RCSN"  tilemap   -- section NRCS, u16 per cell
--   NCER  "RECN"  cells     -- section CEBK, sprite assembly (not parsed here)
--
-- THE MAGICS ARE STORED REVERSED, exactly as NarcArchive's chunk tags are:
-- the file tagged NCLR begins with the bytes "RLCN".  Both spellings appear
-- in circulation, so this compares the four bytes that are actually there.
--
-- WHAT WAS MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED.
--
--   * Section layout is found by WALKING from headerSize for sectionCount
--     chunks, never by fixed offset -- both fields exist because they vary.
--   * The bit depth is confirmed by ARITHMETIC, not by trusting the enum:
--     a 4bpp tile is 32 bytes, so tilesX * tilesY * 32 == dataSize settles
--     it.  pokegra's sprite sheets are 20x10 tiles and 6400 bytes, which is
--     4bpp exactly.
--   * The colour count is dataSize / 2 rather than read from the depth
--     field, which is the one field here whose meaning did not survive
--     inspection: a 16-colour Platinum palette carries 4 where the published
--     tables say 3.  Since the byte count is unambiguous and self-checking,
--     nothing needs the enum to be right.
--   * tilesX / tilesY are 0xFFFF on an UNSIZED graphic -- every party icon
--     is one.  Those get their shape from the NCER cell bank, or from the
--     caller; `tiles` is always correct because it comes from the byte
--     count.  Reading 0xFFFF as a width produces a 65535-tile-wide image and
--     an out-of-memory rather than a wrong picture, which at least fails
--     loudly, but it still has to be handled.
--
-- VALIDATION.  The parser was run against the cartridge and the result
-- looked at, not just counted: all 540 party icons in
-- /poketool/icongra/pl_poke_icon.narc render as recognisable Pokemon in the
-- right colours.  The LZ was checked on every compressed member of four
-- graphics archives -- 125 of 125 decompress to exactly their declared size
-- and every one of them turns out to be a valid Nitro container (48 NCGR,
-- 27 NSCR, 23 NCER, 23 NANR).
--
-- THE BATTLE SPRITES NEED TWO MORE THINGS, and both of them look like the
-- other one when you only have one.  pokegra and otherpoke are ENCRYPTED
-- (see decryptSprite) and they are also stored as LINEAR BITMAPS rather than
-- as 8x8 tiles (see `bitmap`).  Decrypt without un-tiling and you get real
-- Pokemon colours smeared into horizontal bands, which reads as "the cipher
-- is nearly right"; un-tile without decrypting and you get noise, which reads
-- as "the layout is fine, the cipher is wrong".  Neither is a clue about the
-- other, and chasing either one alone goes nowhere.

-- The battle-sprite cipher
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- pokegra and otherpoke XOR their tile data with a keystream from the same
-- linear congruential generator the series uses everywhere else:
--
--   key = the FIRST halfword of the data
--   for each halfword:  plain = cipher ~ key;  key = (key * 0x41C64E6D + 0x6073) % 2^16
--
-- Only the low 16 bits of the state ever matter, because the output is the
-- low 16 bits and an LCG's low bits depend on nothing above them -- so this
-- keeps the state in 16 bits and never needs 32-bit arithmetic Lua 5.1 would
-- make awkward.
--
-- The first halfword being the key is the same statement as "the first
-- halfword of the picture is transparent", since anything XORed with itself
-- is zero.  Every sprite in the cartridge begins with blank pixels, so this
-- is self-seeding and there is no table of keys anywhere.
--
-- HOW THIS WAS FOUND, because the wrong way round wasted real time.  The
-- published constants were tried first and appeared to fail, then all eight
-- combinations of seed/direction/key-half failed, then a brute force over all
-- 65,536 seeds failed.  Every one of those was scored against MEMBER 0 of
-- pl_pokegra -- which is a placeholder that decrypts to noise no matter what
-- you do to it.  The algorithm had been right the whole time and the test
-- subject was the problem.
--
-- What settled it was not another guess: assume the leading plaintext is
-- zero, read the leading ciphertext AS the keystream, and solve the
-- recurrence k[i+1] = (k[i]*A + C) mod 2^16 for A and C from the values
-- themselves.  34 of 38 sprites gave A = 0x4E6D and C = 0x6073 -- which is
-- exactly the published LCG -- and the four that disagreed are the ones whose
-- first tile is not blank, so the "keystream" read from them included
-- picture.  Solving beats searching when the unknown is small.

-- `firstTile` is WHERE THE SHEET WAS LOADED, not an offset into the picture,
-- and leaving it out is what made the Poke Ball step of the intro a field of
-- one repeated tile with a hole in the middle.
--
-- A tilemap's cells index VRAM, not the member they were shipped beside.  The
-- intro's ball is sixteen tiles (member 32/33/34, 512 bytes each) and its
-- tilemap (member 40) points at tiles 32..47, because the app loads those
-- sixteen at tile 32 of the background's character base.  Composed without
-- that base every ball cell fell past the end of a 16-tile sheet and came out
-- transparent, while the 736 cells that hold tile 0 -- the empty ones -- all
-- drew the sheet's own tile 0 instead.  The picture was the exact inverse of
-- the ball: a repeated glyph everywhere and a 48x48 hole where the ball goes.
--
-- Nothing else in that archive needs it and that was checked rather than
-- assumed: the five backdrops run to tile 121 and the figures' tilemap to 127,
-- both inside their own 128-tile sheets.  Only the ball is loaded high.
-- grayscalePalette(palette, count) -> the same palette, greyed the DS's way
--
-- `BattleAnimUtil_ConvertColorsToGrayscale` is one line of pret:
--   `y = RGB_TO_GRAYSCALE(r, g, b)` = `(r * 76 + g * 151 + b * 29) >> 8`
-- on FIVE-BIT channels, written back as `(y << 10) | (y << 5) | y`. The weights sum
-- to 256, so white stays white and nothing can overflow.
--
-- THE FIVE BITS MATTER, which is why this converts back down before weighting and
-- up again after. `palette` has already expanded each channel to eight bits
-- (`round(v * 255 / 31)`), and weighting the expanded values then re-rounding gives
-- a slightly different grey from the cartridge's -- a difference of one or two
-- levels on most colours, which is exactly the kind of thing that makes a port
-- "nearly" right in a way nothing can measure. The expansion is invertible over
-- 0..31, so going back is exact rather than approximate.
--
-- `count` is how many ENTRIES to grey and defaults to the cartridge's own scope:
-- `PALETTE_SIZE * BATTLE_BG_PALETTE_MON_SPRITE` is 16 * 8 = 128, sub-palettes 0 to
-- 7, which leaves the Pokemon-sprite palette at slot 8 and the effect
-- background's at slot 9 in colour.

-- paletteAtSlot(palette, slot) -> a sparse palette for `compose`
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. A 4bpp background's tilemap cell carries a four-bit
-- SUB-PALETTE index, and `compose` reads colour `cell.palette * 16 + value`. A
-- sheet whose palette member holds one sixteen-colour palette is therefore only
-- composable if that palette sits where the cells say it does -- and the game
-- decides where that is when it loads it, not the archive.
--
-- The move-animation effect backgrounds are the case that needs it:
-- `PaletteData_LoadBufferFromFileStart(..., PLTT_DEST(BATTLE_BG_PALETTE_EFFECT))`
-- puts their sixteen colours in SLOT 9, and 64,866 of the 115,712 cells in those
-- tilemaps name sub-palette 9. Composed with the palette at slot 0 every one of
-- those cells reads past the end of a sixteen-entry table and comes out
-- transparent: all 81 of the effect backgrounds compose to an empty picture,
-- which is exactly what happened the first time.
--
-- THE OTHER 50,846 CELLS NAME SLOT 0, and this leaves them transparent, which is
-- deliberate: nothing loads a slot-0 palette for that layer, so on the hardware
-- those cells show whatever the battle backdrop left in the main BG palette's
-- first sixteen entries. 11,708 of them point at a tile with ink in it (tiles 1,
-- 24 and 26). Painting those in some invented colour would be this port drawing
-- art the cartridge does not, so they are dropped and the count is recorded.

-- A PALETTE AS ONE STRING, so the cache can carry every screen's colours
-- without carrying 33,904 Lua tables.
--
-- WHY THE CACHE NEEDS THEM AT ALL.  A composed screen picture cannot contain
-- a colour that appears nowhere but in TEXT, and Platinum's text is drawn at
-- runtime out of a sub-palette the app's own C code names -- TEXT_COLOR(1, 2,
-- 0) on BG palette 3 for the bag, on BG palette 15 for the trainer card.  So
-- every screen that prints anything had to have its ink written down by hand,
-- and a hand-written colour is a colour that can be wrong without anything
-- noticing.  Published here, it is the cartridge's.
--
-- WHY HEX AND NOT A TABLE.  146 distinct palettes across the fifteen UI
-- archives, 129 of them full 256-colour banks: 33,904 colours in all.  As
-- nested `{ r, g, b }` that is about 850 KB of Lua source; as six hex digits
-- a colour it is about 200 KB, and it decodes with one `tonumber` per
-- channel.  The cache is a file the importer writes and the game reads, not
-- a thing anyone hand-edits, so the compact form costs nothing.
--
-- The string is RRGGBB per colour, in palette order, with NO separator.

  --
  -- The DS lays a background's screen data out in 32x32-ENTRY BLOCKS, one per
  -- 256x256 pixels, in reading order -- so a 512x256 map is TWO blocks side by
  -- side and its first 1024 cells are the WHOLE LEFT HALF, not the top two
  -- rows of the full width.  Reading it as one 64-wide grid interleaves the
  -- halves every 32 cells, and the result is a picture chopped into 256-pixel
  -- strips stacked in the wrong order.
  --
  -- Reported from play: the battle backdrop drew "flat horizontal bands with a
  -- black stripe through the middle". Platinum's outdoor backdrops ARE
  -- horizontal gradients -- that part is the cartridge's own art -- but the
  -- stripe was this: the transparent bottom of each half landing in the middle
  -- of the picture. pl_batt_bg member 2 states it twice over, and neither
  -- statement needs the art to read:
  --   * block 0 row 0 is tiles 576,1,2..31 and block 1 row 0 is 31,30..1,576 --
  --     the same run mirrored, with the H-flip bit set on 607 of block 1's
  --     cells and on NONE of block 0's. A 512-wide backdrop is a 256-wide
  --     gradient beside its own mirror, which is what makes the scroll seamless.
  --   * every blank cell starts at ROW 20 OF EACH BLOCK -- one clean horizontal
  --     boundary at y 160, where the platforms and battlers take over. Read
  --     linearly the blanks span rows 10 through 31, which is the stripe.
  --
  -- 199 of the cartridge's 983 tilemaps move because of this, so it was never
  -- only the backdrop: the town map, the box screens, the title demo and the
  -- Frontier backgrounds are all in the list.
  --
  -- ONLY AT THE HARDWARE'S OWN BG SIZES, which above 256x256 are exactly
  -- 512x256, 256x512 and 512x512. Everything else stays linear, and the
  -- restriction is deliberate rather than cautious:
  --   * ten members state sizes the hardware has no BG for at all (352x192,
  --     384x144, 448x192, 320x72, 256x400, 256x488, 256x504). Those are laid
  --     out by software and splitting them would scramble screens that work.
  --   * two more state 1024x1024, which is not a text BG size either. THE
  --     BLOCK RULE IS NOT VERIFIED THERE and both readings happen to fill the
  --     same top half (8,192 cells, exactly half the grid), so extrapolating
  --     would be a guess dressed as a rule. Left linear until something proves
  --     otherwise.
  -- Measured over the cartridge's 983 tilemaps: 201 compose differently now
  -- (131 at 512x256, 68 at 512x512, 2 at 1024x1024 -- the last of which this
  -- restriction puts back), ten are a single block column and so unchanged by
