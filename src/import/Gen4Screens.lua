-- Gen 4 (Platinum) user interface: which archive members make up each screen.
--
-- The title sequence, the start menu, the summary pages, the bag, the trainer
-- card and the Poketch are all built the same way -- tiles, a palette and a
-- tilemap -- but the three parts are NOT stored together and NOT in a fixed
-- order.  In pl_winframe, message_box_00's tiles are member 3 and its palette
-- is member 26; taking members in threes puts the wrong palette on every
-- frame, which produces a picture rather than an error, in the wrong colours.
--
-- What pairs them is the NAME.  Gen4Archives recovers the names, and this
-- module says what to do with them:
--
--   * A group with tiles, a palette and a tilemap is a SCREEN -- compose all
--     three and you have the picture as the game draws it.
--   * A group with only a tilemap borrows the tiles and palette from the
--     archive's main sheet.  This is how the ten summary pages work: one
--     shared 480-tile sheet, ten tilemaps over it.
--   * A group with tiles and a palette but no tilemap is a SHEET -- a set of
--     pieces the game assembles through OAM, not a screen.  It is laid out at
--     a stated width so it can be looked at, and that layout is provisional.
--
-- The point of the table below is that it is nearly all derivable.  Only the
-- shared-sheet choice and the sheet widths are stated, and each is stated
-- because the archive genuinely does not record it.

local Gen4Archives = require("src.import.Gen4Archives")

local Gen4Screens = {}

-- The archives that make up the parts of the game the player actually looks
-- at.  `label` is what the progress line says; `shared` names the group that
-- supplies tiles and palette to tilemap-only groups; `tilesWide` is the
-- fallback layout width for sheets that carry no size, and `tilesWideFor`
-- overrides it for the ones whose real width is known.
--
-- A WRONG WIDTH IS NOT A WRONG SIZE, IT IS A DIFFERENT PICTURE.  The tiles
-- are all there and all in order either way, so nothing fails and nothing
-- looks empty; the pieces simply land next to the wrong neighbours.  That is
-- why `tilesWideFor` states a width rather than letting the fallback stand:
-- `pocket_selector_icons` came out 64x64 instead of 256x16 and drew as tile
-- soup in the bag's pocket strip, and measuring the 64x64 file only ever
-- confirmed whatever the 64x64 file happened to contain.
--
-- THE FALLBACK WAS ALMOST NEVER RIGHT.  The cache already marks every sheet
-- whose width it guessed -- `provisionalLayout` in `gen4_graphics` -- and
-- there are 113 of them.  Checked one by one against the width pokeplatinum
-- states for the same graphic: 110 wrong, 3 right, and the three are right by
-- coincidence rather than by rule.  Eight tiles was never a measurement; it
-- was the number a sheet gets when nothing knows.  The widths below are the
-- cartridge's.

-- TWO NAMING CONVENTIONS LIVE IN THESE ARCHIVES, and a planner that knows only
-- one silently drops half the game's screens.
--
--   SUBJECT-NAMED.  The base name is the thing and the extension is the role:
--   "message_box_00.NCGR" with "message_box_00.NCLR", "logo.NCGR" with
--   "logo.NCLR" and "logo.NSCR".  Grouping by base name is exactly right.
--
--   ROLE-NAMED.  The NAME is the role and the archive is the thing:
--   shop_gra is "tiles.NCGR", "default.NCLR", "tilemap.NSCR",
--   "tilemap_no_item.NSCR".  Here every base name differs, so grouping by
--   base name produces four groups of one and not a single composable screen.
--
-- A third case sits between them: pl_plist_gra names its sheet
-- "subscreen_tiles.NCGR" and its tilemap "subscreen.NSCR", so the two belong
-- together but their bases differ by a suffix.
--
-- So: normalise away the role suffixes, then let a group that is missing a
-- part fall back to the archive's own sheet and palette.  Falling back is
-- recorded on the job rather than hidden, because a borrowed palette is a
-- guess and a guess that is not marked is indistinguishable from a fact.
-- `_bg_tiles` is FIRST because the list is tried in order and `_tiles` would
-- otherwise match it and leave a stray `_bg`.  Its absence was the whole
-- reason the Pokétch drew as tile soup: every app names its background
-- `<app>_bg_tiles.NCGR` beside `<app>.NSCR`, and without this suffix the two
-- never grouped, so each app's tilemap fell back to the archive's shared
-- sheet -- the device border -- and composed the border's tiles through the
-- app's map.
