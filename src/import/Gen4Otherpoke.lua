-- Alternate-form battle pictures: pl_otherpoke.narc.
--
-- 253 members, and the only thing in this cartridge's graphics that has no
-- pattern at all.  pokeplatinum's own build says so out loud -- `otherpoke_index
-- = {} # otherpoke uses a unique, non-uniform structure` -- and the index below
-- is that structure, read out of the per-species meson files that populate it
-- (res/pokemon/<species>/meson.build) rather than inferred from the archive.
--
-- THE SHAPE, from tools/scripts/make_pl_otherpoke.py and the 154/94 counts the
-- build passes it:
--   0..153    sprites (NCGR), 20x10 tiles at 4bpp
--   154..247  palettes (NCLR), 16 colours
--   248..250  the Substitute doll: back, front, palette
--   251..252  the in-battle shadows and their palette
-- Verified against the cartridge: every member in 0..153 IS an NCGR of that
-- shape and every member in 154..247 IS a 16-colour NCLR, 0 wrong.
--
-- WHY THIS IS A TABLE AND NOT ARITHMETIC.  Two orderings coexist inside the
-- same archive and neither announces itself:
--
--   INTERLEAVED   Deoxys, Unown, Burmy, Wormadam, Arceus, Shaymin, Rotom,
--                 Giratina -- back, front, back, front, one pair per form
--   GROUPED       Castform, Shellos, Gastrodon, Cherrim -- EVERY back, then
--                 EVERY front
--
-- Castform's four backs are 64-67 and its four fronts are 68-71.  Read as
-- interleaved, Castform-sunny's "back" is Castform-rainy's back and its
-- "front" is Castform-base's front: four plausible pictures, all of the wrong
-- forms, and nothing anywhere reports an error.  The palettes split the same
-- way -- Castform and Cherrim group normal-then-shiny while everyone else
-- alternates -- so the same guess also hands sunny Castform snowy's colours.
--
-- THIRTY FORMS HAVE NO PALETTE OF THEIR OWN.  Deoxys's three alternate formes
-- and Unown's twenty-seven letters are recoloured from their species' BASE
-- palette; only their sheets differ.  `palette` is nil for those, and
-- `Gen4Otherpoke.palettes` falls back to the base form's rather than leaving
-- them black.
--
-- THE EGG IS NOT A POKEMON HERE.  Members 132/133 are the ordinary egg and the
-- Manaphy egg: a front picture and a normal palette each, no back and no shiny,
-- because an egg is never sent out and never sparkles.  `species = 0` marks
-- them as belonging to no species row.
--
-- Every `base` form duplicates what pl_pokegra already holds for that species.
-- That is the cartridge's doing, not a mistake here: the form-switching code
-- reads one archive rather than two, so the base art is in both.
