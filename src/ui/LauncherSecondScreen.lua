-- THE BOTTOM SCREEN, BEFORE A GAME IS EVEN CHOSEN.
--
-- Reported from play: "its still not detecting the second screen on the ayn
-- thor for platinum maybe the launcher itself has to intialize with it".
--
-- That is exactly it, and for a plainer reason than the report guesses. The
-- panel's frame is sent by `SecondScreen.flush`, and the only caller was
-- `Game:draw` -- but `love.draw` returns at `Importer:draw()` and never
-- reaches `Game:draw` while the launcher is up. So no frame was ever pushed
-- before a game started, the host had nothing to show, and a player looking at
-- a blank bottom panel on the game list concluded the device was not detected.
-- Nothing was wrong with the detection; nothing was asking.
--
-- So this is what the second screen shows while the launcher owns the window:
-- every game as a tile in a grid, sortable, and a button through to the mods
-- panel. It is the launcher's own second screen, not a preview of a game's.
--
-- WHY IT DRAWS IN LOVE'S DEFAULT FONT and nothing prettier: at launcher time
-- NO CARTRIDGE CACHE IS MOUNTED. Every font this engine draws with is baked
-- from ROM data that does not exist yet, so reaching for one here would either
-- raise or silently draw nothing. The default font is the only one guaranteed
-- to be there this early, and a legible panel beats a themed blank one.
--
-- WHY IT IS INERT WITHOUT A PANEL: `tick` returns immediately unless
-- `SecondScreen.deviceReady()` says a real second display is attached. On a
-- phone, a desktop, a handheld with one screen -- every platform but the ones
-- this is for -- it costs one boolean per frame and allocates nothing. It
-- never draws into the window: a launcher that grew a second panel in the
-- corner of a single-screen device would be a regression, not a feature.
