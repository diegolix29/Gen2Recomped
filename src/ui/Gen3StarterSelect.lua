-- CHOOSING A STARTER, the way Emerald asks.
--
-- Not a list of three words.  The cartridge draws a patch of grass with three
-- Poke Balls sitting on it, a hand you move between them, and the Pokemon's
-- picture and name above whichever one you are pointing at.  A text menu is
-- not a smaller version of that screen, it is a different screen -- and it is
-- the first thing a new game asks the player to do.
--
-- EVERY NUMBER HERE IS THE CARTRIDGE'S.  The extractor finds the whole screen
-- from sStarterMon: the grass is the 256-tile character block beside it, the
-- three ball positions are the six bytes in front of it, the label positions
-- the six bytes behind it, and the balls and the hand are the four 32x32
-- frames in the sheet that follows the grass.  Nothing on this screen is a
-- position somebody eyeballed, which is why moving the balls means re-reading
-- the ROM rather than editing this file.
--
--     constants.gen3StarterSelect = {
--       background = "...png",  sprites = "...png",
--       ballX = { 60, 120, 180 }, ballY = { 64, 88, 64 },
--       labelX = { 0, 128, 64 },  labelY = { 72, 80, 32 },
--       handFrame = 4, ...
--     }
--
-- The two coordinate tables are NOT related to each other, which is the thing
-- to know before editing anything here: sPokeballCoords is in pixels and
-- sStarterLabelCoords, six bytes after it at 5B1DF2, is in TILES, and the
-- plate a Pokemon's name goes in can sit on the opposite side of the screen
-- from the ball it names -- Mudkip's ball is at x 180 and its plate at x 64.
--
-- WHAT IS RECONSTRUCTED: the bounce the balls do, the speed the hand moves,
-- and the fact that the picture is drawn above the ball rather than in a
-- fixed panel.  Those are timing and staging, not data, and they are the
-- part to correct against a recording.
--
-- POINTING AT A BALL IS NOT CHOOSING IT.  The screen has two halves and only
-- the first one was here.  On the cartridge the grass carries nothing but
-- three balls and a hand until A is pressed; then the Pokemon's front picture
-- grows out of the ball it was in, a label window names it and its dex
-- category, and the game ASKS -- "Do you choose this POKeMON?" -- with a
-- YES/NO box.  NO takes the picture away again and hands the player back to
-- the row.
--
-- That confirm step is the whole reason the player sees their starter before
-- the story takes it away: it is the only time in the opening that its
-- picture is on screen.  Without it the first look a player gets at the
-- Pokemon they will carry for sixty hours is a name in a list.
--
-- The question is the CARTRIDGE'S OWN STRING, named by the extractor as the
-- one line in twelve thousand containing "choose this" -- the wording below
-- is only what a cache imported before that existed will show.

-- and Route 101 stops existing until the callback returns.  `isOpaque` is this

-- to do with where the ball is: Mudkip's ball is at x 180 and its plate is at
