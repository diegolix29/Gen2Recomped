-- Professor Rowan's briefcase, which is the first 3D this port draws itself.
--
-- Everything on this screen is the cartridge's own: `psel_all` out of
-- `ev_pokeselect` is one model holding the case, its lid, the three Poke Balls
-- and their shadows; the animation of the same name is 41 frames over its 12
-- joints, and it is what opens the case and tips the balls out in front of it.
-- The words are message bank 360 and the three species are the ones
-- `choose_starter_app.c` names.
--
-- WHAT THIS FILE INVENTS, said here so it is never mistaken for extracted
-- data, and it is now a much shorter list than it was:
--
--   * THE LIFT ON THE SELECTED BALL.  The cartridge has a 73-frame animation
--     per ball for this and they are extracted; what it does with them is app
--     code rather than data, so this raises the chosen one instead.
-- AND THE CAMERA IS NO LONGER ONE OF THEM.  It used to be: "distance and pitch
-- are chosen to frame the posed model", plus a slow endless orbit.  Every one
-- of those numbers is stated outright in `choose_starter_app.c` -- see the
-- camera block below -- and the cartridge's yaw is ZERO AND STAYS ZERO, so the
-- turntable was not a liberty, it was a thing the game does not do.
--
-- AND WHAT USED TO BE HERE.  An earlier version of this screen placed the
-- three balls itself -- a spread measured off the case's inside floor, evenly
-- divided, with the middle ball level with the others.  All of that was wrong,
-- and wrong in a way no amount of measuring the case could have fixed: the
-- positions are in the model's NODE transforms, which this engine did not read
-- until now.  The cartridge puts them at x = -30, 0 and +30 with the middle
-- one 6 units nearer the floor, and the animation then moves all three.

-- that rect in the port's convention (interior plus one tile of border), which
-- is what Font.drawDialogueBox expands.  `{ 0, 16, 32, 8 }` was two rows too
-- tall and, once the frame reader was fixed to reach past its rect, one tile

-- !! THE MODEL IS Y-UP, AND THIS FILE USED TO ROTATE IT AS THOUGH IT WERE NOT.
--
-- There was a `Z_UP_TO_Y_UP` here, a 90-degree turn about X applied to the
-- whole scene, justified as "`psel_all` was exported with the vertical axis
-- last -- its lid reaches y = 116 in what the case model calls depth".  The
-- 116 is real and the reading of it was wrong: it is the SECOND component of
-- psel_all's box, which is Y.  (`psel_trunk` -- the case on its own, in its own
-- rest pose with the lid already swung back -- is the model that reaches 116 in
-- Z, and that is where the observation came from.)
--
-- THREE INDEPENDENT THINGS SAY Y IS UP, and any one of them settles it:
--
--   * `pmsel_bg`, the ground it stands on, measures
--     lo = (-160, 0, -304) and hi = (160, 0, 208) -- 320 by 512 units of floor
--     with EXACTLY ZERO THICKNESS IN Y.  A plane flat in an axis is a plane of
--     constant height in that axis.
--   * `SetupCamera` ends with `Camera_SetUp(&(VecFx32){0, FX32_ONE, 0})`.
--     The cartridge states its up vector and it is +Y.
--   * The header of this very file already knew.  It records the balls at
--     x = -30, 0 and +30 "with the middle one 6 units nearer the floor", and
--     the node translations are (-30, 50, 0), (0, 44, 0), (30, 50, 0): the six
--     units are in Y, so Y is the axis the floor is measured along.
--
-- Rotated, the case lay on its back, the floor stood up as a slab across the
-- corner, and the camera -- see below -- was underneath it looking up.
--
-- THE CAMERA, EVERY NUMBER OF IT FROM `choose_starter_app.c`.
--
-- `SetupCamera` opens the scene with target (0,0,0), distance 300, angle.x
-- `(-30 * 0xffff) / 360`, angle.y ZERO, fovY `(22 * 0xffff) / 360`.
-- `StartCameraMovement` then runs ONCE, over six steps, before "These are Poke
-- Balls!" is printed: angle.x -30 -> -50 degrees, distance 300 -> 200, and the
-- target's z 0 -> 36.  `AdvanceStarterMovement` is linear in the step count.
--
-- TWO CONVENTIONS TO GET RIGHT, both checked rather than assumed:
--
--   * 22 IS THE HALF ANGLE.  `NNS_G3dGlbPerspective` takes sin and cos of the
--     fov and forms `cos/sin` for the y scale, i.e. 1/tan(fov) where the
--     standard matrix has 1/tan(full/2).  The orthographic branch of
--     `Camera_ComputeProjectionMatrix` says the same thing out loud:
--     `top = tan(fovY) * distance`, which is a half-height.  So the full
--     vertical field of view is 44 degrees, which is what
--     `Gen4Model.perspective` takes.
--   * `Gen4Model.orbit` PUTS THE EYE BELOW THE TARGET FOR A POSITIVE PITCH.
--     Evaluated rather than reasoned about: orbit({0,0,0}, 300, 0, rad(-30))
--     gives eye (0, 150, 259.8), and `Camera_AdjustPositionAroundTarget`
--     computes exactly that from angle.x = -30.  So the cartridge's own signed
--     number is handed straight to `orbit` and the two agree to the decimal.
--     The old code passed +0.55, which is the same shot from underneath.
--
-- The clip planes corroborate the whole reading: the cartridge's own
-- CAMERA_DEFAULT_NEAR_CLIP 150 and FAR_CLIP 900 fit this scene at these
-- distances with room to spare (measured 174.8 to 406.7 from the eye across
-- both camera stages) -- and they would not if the scale or the distances were
-- wrong, so they are used here as stated.

-- !! AND REMOVING THAT ROTATION LEFT A FLIP BEHIND IT.
--
-- Reported from play: "the starter selection briefcase seems to be upside
-- down and the pokeballs too".  They were: the balls drew white half up, and
-- the case opened its lid DOWNWARDS and tipped the balls out upwards.
--
-- The cause is written down in `Gen4Title`, which hit it first and said so:
-- a custom `position()` in a LOVE shader returns clip coordinates directly,
-- and A CANVAS'S FRAMEBUFFER COUNTS ITS ROWS THE OPPOSITE WAY ROUND FROM THE
-- SCREEN.  Its note even names this file as the reason it had not been seen
-- everywhere -- "`Gen4Model.orbit` does not hit this because the starter
-- select composes it with a Z-up-to-Y-up rotation that inverts the axis on
-- the way past".
--
-- So the `Z_UP_TO_Y_UP` the block above removed was wrong AND was cancelling
-- this, and taking the wrong one away uncovered the one it had been hiding.
-- Two mistakes that had been making a right picture; the block above fixed
-- the first and nothing put anything in the second's place.
--
-- Negating clip Y rather than the up vector, for the reason `Gen4Title`
-- gives: flipping `up` would swap the handedness of the side vector too and
-- mirror the case left to right, trading one wrong picture for another.

  0, 0, 0, 1,
}

-- Straight up is Y, which is the whole point of the block above.
-- WHERE THE CHOSEN ONE APPEARS, and it appears ONLY THEN.
--
-- Reported from play: "in the rom it doesnt show the name or picture of the
-- pokemon until you click it".  Right on both counts, and this screen had it
-- wrong in both directions at once: it drew ALL THREE NAMES in a row under
-- the case from the moment the case finished opening, and it never drew a
-- picture at all.
--
-- `AdvancePokeballConfirmGraphics` is the cartridge's own sequence, and every
-- part of it waits for the button: on A it hides the cursor, DELETES THE
-- SUBPLANE WINDOW -- the bottom screen where the three names live, which is
-- why they were never on this screen to begin with -- slides the preview
-- window in, clears `MON_SPRITE_HIDE` on that one sprite, plays its cry, and
-- only then prints bank 360's entry `1 + cursorPosition`, which is the line
-- that names the species.  Cancel slides it back out, re-hides the sprite and
-- prints entry 7 again.
--
-- So the name was never a thing to draw separately: it arrives inside the
-- offer text, and the offer text arrives on A.
--
-- `POKEMON_SPRITE_POS_X` is 128 and `POKEMON_SPRITE_POS_Y` 96 -- the middle
-- of the DS screen -- and `StartPreviewGraphicsMovement` ends at exactly that
-- pair at scale 1.0, so that is where the picture settles.

-- for starter3DGraphics[2..4].
--
-- CONFIRMED TWICE, FROM TWO SOURCES THAT NEVER MET.  The last frame of
-- `psel_all`'s own animation leaves its ball joints at (-44,-4,32), (0,-4,62)
-- and (38,-4,26) -- read out of the track data -- which is the same three

--     Set3DGraphicsRotation(.., 0, (180 * 0xffff) / 360, 0)
