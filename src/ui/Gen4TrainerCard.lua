-- Platinum's TRAINER CARD, which was falling back to Kanto's.
--
-- Reported from play: "Gen4 bag is missing gen4 pokemon menu is missing gen4
-- options menu is missing and the trainer card as well they are falling back
-- to gen1 art".  This screen now draws Platinum's own card.
--
-- THIS IS THE CARTRIDGE'S CARD, NOT A LIKENESS OF IT.  Three pictures out of
-- `/graphic/trainer_case.narc` and seven row positions out of
-- `src/applications/trainer_case/card_text.c`:
--
--   * `trainer_card/trainer_card_front` and `.../trainer_card_back` -- the
--     two faces, composed from `trainer_card_tiles.NCGR` against the card's
--     own tilemaps.  Drawn at (0, 0); the card sits at y = 8..183 of a
--     256x256 sheet, so the screen's 192 rows hold it with its own margins.
--   * `trainer_card/lucas` or `.../dawn` -- the portrait, by gender.  Its
--     tilemap is full-screen and already positioned: drawn at (0, 0) over the
--     front, the figure lands inside the card's portrait box (x 185..220,
--     y 55..120) without an offset of ours.
--   * THE ROWS come from `sTrainerCardWindowTemplates[]`.  Every window has
--     `tilemapLeft = 2` and `height = 2`, so every label starts at x = 16 and
--     every row is 16 pixels tall.  `TRAINER_CARD_WINDOW_PARTIAL_WIDTH` is 17
--     tiles and `FULL_WIDTH` is 28, so a value's right edge is x = 152 on the
--     short rows and x = 240 on the two long ones.  `tilemapTop` gives the
--     front's rows as 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 20 -- y = 32, 48, 72, 96, 120,
--     144, 160 -- and the back's as 2, 7, 9, 11.
--
-- Every value is RIGHT-ALIGNED to its window's far edge: `TrainerCard_DrawNumber`
-- and `TrainerCard_DrawString` both print at `windowWidth - (width + endXOffset)`,
-- and the three fields that do not go through them compute the same `xOffset`
-- by hand.  Labels print at 0.  So: label left, value right, on one line.
--
-- THE ENUM PUTS ID BEFORE NAME.  This screen used to print NAME first, which
-- is the Game Boy card's order.  Platinum's is IDNo., NAME, MONEY, POKeDEX,
-- SCORE, TIME, ADVENTURE STARTED.
--
-- TWO CORRECTIONS TO THE FIELDS THEMSELVES, both from `TrainerCase_Init`:
--
--   * POKeDEX IS THE SEEN COUNT, not the owned count -- `Pokedex_CountSeen`.
--     This screen counted owned.
--   * THE ID IS THE LOW HALF, `TrainerInfo_ID_LowHalf`, printed as five
--     digits zero-padded.  Taking it modulo 100000 let a six-digit id show
--     its bottom five rather than its real low half.
--
-- THE TEXT COLOUR is `TEXT_COLOR(1, 2, 0)` on BG palette 15 in every one of
-- the eleven printer calls.  The card is 8bpp, so that is palette entries 241
-- and 242 of the card's own NCLR: (74, 74, 74) for the letter and
-- (164, 164, 164) for its shadow.  Written down rather than read, for the
-- reason [[gen4_screen_palettes]] gives -- the cache publishes the composed
-- picture, which cannot contain a colour that appears only in text.
--
-- WHAT THE PORT CANNOT FILL IN, named rather than faked:
--
--   * SCORE is `GameRecords_GetTrainerScore`, which the port has no record
--     of, so it prints 0 -- the value a new cartridge save prints too.
--   * ADVENTURE STARTED needs a start date the save does not keep, so it
--     prints the cartridge's own blank form, `--- --, ----`.
--   * THE WHOLE BACK FACE is link and Hall-of-Fame records the port does not
--     keep.  It prints the cartridge's blanks and zeroes, which is exactly
--     what Platinum prints before any of it has happened.
--   * THE SIGNATURE panel on the back is part of the art; nothing is written
--     into it.
--
-- THE CARD LEVEL IS NOT THE BADGE COUNT.  An earlier note here guessed it
-- was.  `TrainerCase_CalculateTrainerCardLevel` counts five unrelated
-- things -- game completed, national dex completed, a 100-win Battle Tower
-- streak, contest master in any of five ranks, and an Underground Platinum
-- base flag -- and picks `trainer_card_normal/cobalt/bronze/silver/gold/
-- black` by the total.  Only the first is reachable in the port today.  The
-- six palettes differ ONLY in rows 1-3 and row 15, row 0 being identical in
-- all six, so a level face is one more compose of the same tilemap against a
-- different NCLR -- an EXTRACTOR change, not a screen one, and the cache
-- carries one face today.  Same for `trainer_card_normal_no_dex`; what this
-- screen CAN do without it, and does, is leave the POKeDEX row out entirely
-- before the dex is obtained, as `TrainerCard_DrawFrontText` does.
--
-- WHY A IS A THREE-WAY CYCLE HERE AND A TWO-WAY FLIP ON THE CARTRIDGE.
-- Platinum shows BOTH at once: `GX_SetDispSelect(GX_DISP_SELECT_SUB_MAIN)`
-- puts the sub engine on the top screen, and the card's three layers are all
-- sub while the badge case's two are main -- so the card is the top screen,
-- the badge case is the touch screen, and A flips only the card.  This port
-- shows one screen at a time, so A walks front -> back -> badge case.  The
-- faithful arrangement is for the case to live on the bottom screen behind
-- the screen-toggle button; that is where it belongs once that is wired.
--
-- WHAT IS THE CARTRIDGE'S ON THE BADGE PAGE:
--
--   * THE BADGE CASE SCREEN, `trainer_card/badge_case` -- the "LEAGUE BADGES"
--     panel with its eight empty sockets, composed from its own tilemap.
--   * THE EIGHT BADGES, `trainer_card/badge_case_sprites_00..07`.
--   * WHERE THE BADGES GO.  Measured off the panel rather than guessed: the
--     eight sockets are the only shapes on it darker than its own background,
--     and they come out at x = 43, 99, 155, 211 and y = 59, 115 -- a pitch of
--     56 both ways, four across and two down.  Each badge's art sits in the
--     top-left 40x40 of its 64x64 frame centred on (19.5, 19.5), so a badge
--     drawn twenty pixels up and left of a socket's centre lands in it.
--
-- AND A NOTE ON HOW THE FACE GOT HERE, because both of its faults were ones
-- this file once reported as something else.  The face was scrambled because
-- its tilemap is AFFINE -- one byte per cell, bare tile id -- and the reader
-- took two; that is fixed in `Gen4Graphics.tilemap`.  The portraits were
-- never "composing correctly": they were composing in the badge-case lid's
-- palette, because no NCLR in this archive is named after the card and the
-- planner's fallback found the lid's.  Lucas came out in a tan cap and brown
-- trousers, the right shape in the wrong paint, and an opaque-pixel count
-- said nothing about it.  `palettesFrom` in `Gen4Screens` now names
-- `trainer_card_normal.NCLR` for all four.  Both faults needed LOOKING at
-- the picture; neither showed up in a number.
