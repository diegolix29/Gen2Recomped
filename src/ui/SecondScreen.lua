-- THE SECOND SCREEN, and it is never a second window.
--
-- From the original brief: "Instead of having two screens for the poketch and
-- bottom screen allow users to switch between the two with a button or have the
-- choice of using a button to show the bottom screen in the top right corner
-- with a hotkey and change its size and interact with it there."
--
-- The game runs in ONE window, like every other version in this launcher, and
-- the player chooses how the bottom screen reaches them.  This module owns that
-- choice and nothing else: it answers WHERE the bottom screen is right now, in
-- the same 256x192 space every Gen 4 screen already draws in, and it wraps a
-- draw so a screen can be written once and appear in either place.
--
-- IT DOES NOT OWN THE STACK.  A screen that wants to be a bottom-screen screen
-- asks for the transform and draws itself; nothing here pushes, pops, or knows
-- what is on the stack.  That is deliberate: the alternative -- a manager that
-- decides which screens are "bottom screen" ones -- puts a second, invisible
-- stack next to the real one, and the first disagreement between them is a
-- screen that cannot be closed.
--
-- THE MODES
--
--   swap    the bottom screen takes the whole window when it is up.  Works at
--           any window size and on a phone, and the DS's own split costs
--           nothing here because the bottom screen is almost never needed
--           DURING an action -- it is a thing you stop to look at.
--   inset   a panel in the TOP-RIGHT corner over the main screen, raised and
--           lowered with a hotkey, interactive in place, and resizable.
--   display a REAL second panel -- the AYN Thor's lower screen, or any other
--           Android secondary display, or an HDMI one.  The window keeps the
--           top screen and never shows the bottom one at all.  Only offered
--           where the host can actually reach a second panel; see
--           `deviceReady` below for why that gate degrades to `swap` rather
--           than to nothing.
--   off     Gen 1-3, and Gen 4 for a player who wants no second surface at
--           all.  Every caller degrades to drawing on the main screen.
--
-- NOTHING HERE IS REACHABLE FOR GEN 1-3 and no Gen 1-3 draw path gains a
-- branch: `SecondScreen.mode` returns "off" for them, and "off" is the case
-- every caller already has to handle.
