-- Emerald's title screen.
--
-- Not a branch inside TitleState.  That screen is a Game Boy composition --
-- a logo tile block, a version ribbon, a cycling front sprite out of
-- TitleMons, a copyright row -- and Emerald has none of those things: it is
-- two scrolling background layers, Rayquaza in silhouette with a cloud field
-- drifting over him, and PRESS START.  Sharing one screen between them would
-- have meant a third layout mode inside a file that already carries three.
--
-- THE PICTURE IS THE CARTRIDGE'S.  Both layers come out of the ROM through
-- the scene stage, palettes and all, and are drawn here at the scale that
-- fits a Game Boy screen: the GBA's is 240x160 and this engine's is 160x144,
-- so the art is shown at two thirds and the band it leaves at the bottom
-- carries the wordmark and the prompt.  That band is the honest way round --
-- cropping to 160 wide would cut Rayquaza's own coils off both sides.
--
-- THE WORDMARK IS THE CARTRIDGE'S TOO, now.  It was not: the scene pass finds
-- TILED BACKGROUNDS, and neither half of Emerald's branding is one -- the
-- POKeMON logo is a 256-colour BITMAP whose tilemap is an identity ramp, and
-- EMERALD VERSION is an 8bpp SPRITE that never passes a background loader at
-- all.  Both are found and composed now (see the overlay pass in
-- RomExtractorGen3:extractScenes), so the words are the cartridge's pixels.
-- The font fallback below is what a dataset without them still gets.
--
-- WHAT IS STILL RECONSTRUCTED is where they sit.  A GBA sprite's position
-- comes out of OAM at run time, not out of the sheet, so the two offsets in
-- LOGO_Y / VERSION_Y are measured off the screen rather than derived, and
-- they are the numbers to correct against a screenshot.

-- THE GBA SCREEN, ASKED FOR RATHER THAN SCALED INTO.
--
-- The first version of this drew Emerald's 240x160 title at two thirds inside
-- the Game Boy's 160x144 canvas, letterboxed, with the wordmark in the band it
-- left.  That was wrong twice over: the art resamples at 2/3, which is not a
-- thing pixel art survives, and the whole screen is Emerald's -- there is no
-- Game Boy composition here to preserve.  Renderer:setUISize already exists
-- for exactly this (the widescreen battle asks for 304x144), so this screen
-- asks for the surface the cartridge draws on and uses all of it.

-- THE CLOUDS GO UP, NOT SIDEWAYS, AND THEY WOBBLE.
--
-- Reported from play: "in the main menu the clouds are supposed to scroll
-- upward and move with a wave like distortion not left to right".  They are,
-- and both halves of that are the cartridge's own, read off the title
-- screen's task (0AAD64) and the scanline effect it arms.
--
-- WHICH BACKGROUND IS WHICH.  Running the title's own callback chain through
-- the intro's THUMB interpreter (tools/gen3_intro_act3.py's Cpu, entered at
-- 0AA7A4 with SetMainCallback2 and CreateTask stubbed) gives the control
-- registers outright: BG0CNT 1A0B is Rayquaza (char block 2, map 26, priority
-- 3), BG1CNT 1B0E is the cloud field (char block 3, map 27, priority 2) and
-- BG2CNT 4981 is the 256-colour logo on an affine background in front of both.
-- So the clouds are BG1, and everything below is BG1's.
--
-- THE SCROLL.  Phase three's task does, every OTHER frame, data[4]++ and then
-- writes data[4] / 2 into gBattle_BG1_Y (02022E1A) -- which the title's VBlank
-- hands to BG1VOFS.  A rising VOFS walks the window DOWN the map, which shows
-- as the picture rising: a quarter of a pixel a frame, upward.
--
-- THE WAVE.  The init calls ScanlineEffect_InitWave(0, 160, frequency 4,
-- amplitude 4, delay 0, regOffset 4, battle offsets) -- regOffset 4 is
-- REG_BG0HOFS + 4, which is BG1HOFS, so it is a per-SCANLINE horizontal
-- offset.  The table it builds (0BA33C) is
--     wave[i] = (gSineTable[(i * frequency) & 0xFF] * amplitude) >> 8
-- so with those two arguments it is a sine four pixels either side whose
-- wavelength is 256/4 = 64 scanlines, and a delay interval of zero advances
-- its phase one entry every frame.  Nothing is added to it here: the same
-- task writes gBattle_BG1_X (02022E18), which the effect adds to every row,
-- as zero.

-- RAYQUAZA'S MARKINGS, AND WHAT MAKES THEM APPEAR.
--
-- Reported from play: "Rayquaza is missing the yellow glow in our main menu as
-- well".  There was nothing to draw: the markings are already in the backdrop,
-- in a colour identical to the body they sit on, and the cartridge makes them
-- appear by rewriting that one palette entry.  Gen3Scene.animatedEntry finds
-- which entry that is from the data alone -- palette 14 holds 004A62 at index
-- 11 over the whole silhouette AND at index 15 over 1149 pixels inside it, and
-- a duplicate in a sixteen-colour palette is only worth a slot if something
-- rewrites it -- and maskImage gives those pixels as a stencil.
--
-- THE COLOUR AND THE RATE ARE NOT DERIVED.  The colour is measured off a
-- screenshot of the cartridge and snapped to the GBA's own five bits per
-- channel; the period is one cycle over 256 frames, which is what a routine
-- counting an eight-bit frame number through a cosine gives.  Both are numbers
-- to correct against a capture, like LOGO_Y below.

-- CENTRED ON THE INK, NOT ON THE PADDING.
--
-- Reported from play: "on the main menu the pokemon logo is left aligned

-- was, and the reason is that a GBA background bitmap is as wide as the
-- BACKGROUND: the logo is 166 pixels of art sitting against the left edge of
-- a 256-pixel sheet, and on the cartridge a scroll register puts it on
-- screen.  Centring the sheet on a 240-wide screen therefore starts it eight
-- pixels off the left and the art three pixels after that, which is what a
-- left-aligned logo looks like.
--
-- The importer measures the ink's own box (contentX / contentWidth); this
-- centres THAT, and falls back to the old behaviour for a cache that predates
-- the measurement.
