-- What a NEW GAME on Platinum actually opens with: a television broadcast,
-- then Professor Rowan.
--
-- Until now NEW GAME went straight to the bedroom, because `boot.screens.
-- newGame` was `false` -- OakSpeech replays a professor's intro out of text
-- Platinum does not have, and there was nothing else to put there.  There is
-- now: the `intro` stage extracts both scenes and both scripts, and this plays
-- them.
--
-- THE TELEVISION FIRST.  `RowanIntroTv` is its own application on the
-- cartridge and it runs before Rowan's: a news report about the professor
-- returning to Sinnoh, drawn as three background layers -- the broadcast, a
-- scanline overlay and the set's bezel -- with one line of text under it.
--
-- THEN ROWAN, over five backdrops and ten figures, of which this plays the
-- main line: the greeting, who you are, your name, your friend's name, and the
-- send-off.  The CONTROL INFO and ADVENTURE INFO lectures are extracted and
-- NOT offered here -- they are a menu of tutorials about a touch screen and a
-- +Control Pad this port does not have, and a lecture that describes hardware
-- the player is not holding is worse than one they never saw.  `gen4_intro`
-- carries both so a mod can put them back.
--
-- TWO SCENES ARE NOT WORDS, and both were reported missing from play.
--
--   * THE POKE BALL.  "in the intro rowan isnt thorwing out a pokemon like he
--     does in the rom".  He does: the ball's button is pushed in over three
--     pieces of art, the screen flashes four times, and a BUNEARY -- the
--     species' own battle front sprite, already in this cache -- rises out of
--     it on a parabola, hops right, hops left and settles.  Every number in
--     that sentence is below, taken from the app's own arithmetic.
--   * THE GENDER CHOICE.  "the players sprites when selecting boy or girl
--     arent animated like they should be".  Both avatars stand on screen at
--     once and THE ONE YOU ARE POINTING AT IS RUNNING -- the four "poses"
--     `Gen4IntroScene` extracts as boy_1..boy_4 and girl_1..girl_4 are a
--     four-frame run cycle, so nothing had to be added to the cache to play
--     it.  The other one holds still and is dimmed.
--
-- PAGE BREAKS ARE IN THE TEXT ALREADY.  Gen 4 writes 0x25BC for "wait, then
-- clear" and 0x25BD for "wait, then scroll", and the decoder renders them as
-- CR and FF -- so a page is a split on those characters rather than something
-- this file has to count.
