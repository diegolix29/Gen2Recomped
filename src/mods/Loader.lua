--        to Gen 1 shows here as disabled under Emerald, and flipping only the
--        master would leave it not loading and the switch snapping back.

-- A MOD THE SAVE DIRECTORY IS SHADOWING, SAID OUT LOUD.

-- left there wins over the checkout the author is editing, and LauncherMods
-- already names the symptom in its own words: "the author's own edits
-- silently stop taking effect while the folder they are editing looks
-- untouched.  That is a worse failure than not updating, and it is
-- invisible."
--
-- Reported from play: "when pressing the button mapped to select in the
-- options its still just adjusting the voxels and not working properly not
-- using my registered item in gen3" -- with the change that stops it doing
-- exactly that sitting in the checkout, unread, behind a save-directory copy
-- of the same mod from two days earlier.  Every file said what it should
-- have said; the running game was reading a different one, and nothing
-- anywhere mentioned that a second one existed.
--
-- THIS IS NOT AN ERROR.  Installing a release over a checkout is a
-- legitimate thing to do and the mod loads fine either way.  It is one line
-- in the log naming BOTH files, which is all it ever needed to stop being
-- invisible -- and only when the two differ, so an install of the same build
-- says nothing.
--
-- The read is its own field so a test can stand in for the disk: this is the
-- one check in the loader that deliberately goes around love.filesystem,
-- because love.filesystem is precisely what cannot see the difference.
