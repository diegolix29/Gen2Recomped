-- Launcher-side mod surface (18/launcher redesign): the mods panel runs
-- BEFORE Game:load, so this NEVER loads a mod entry chunk -- it scans
-- manifests only.  The full loader (src/mods/Loader.lua) still owns the real
-- load at boot; this reads the same options.mods enable-state the loader
-- writes, derives per-mod status with the pure ManagerState.resolveToggle,
-- installs a dropped/chosen .zip into a "mods/<id>/" tree, and uninstalls a
-- mod by removing that tree + clearing options.mods[id].
--
-- Where that tree lives is CacheFs's call, not love.filesystem's: a portable
-- install (portable.txt beside the executable) keeps its mods in the game
-- folder like everything else it owns, and only the OS save directory
-- otherwise (#330 -- love.filesystem.write always resolves to the save dir,
-- so the installer used to strand every mod in appdata).  Reads stay on
-- love.filesystem: the portable folder is on the physfs read path either way
-- (it IS the source for a `love <gamedir>` run, and CacheFs mounts it for a
-- fused build), which is why those mods still loaded while landing in the
-- wrong place.
--
-- The same split decides where a mod is FOUND, and that has a sharp edge: a
-- non-portable install never reads the game folder at all, so a mod unzipped
-- next to the executable -- where most games would want it -- is not wrong so
-- much as invisible, with an empty panel and no error to explain it.
-- adoptStrays looks in those folders anyway (a scoped mount that comes down
-- again, CacheFs.withMounted) and copies what it finds into the tree the game
-- really reads, so the mistake costs a line of notice rather than a support
-- thread.
--
-- Split in two: the pure derivation (deriveList, locateRoot, pickStrays) has
-- no love and no filesystem, so the engine tier can table-drive it; the
-- discovery, install, uninstall, and stray-scan paths reach for
-- love.filesystem and SaveData.

-- so the loader and in-game manager no longer see it.  Rejects missing ids.
-- Does not touch other mods' enable state.
-- WHICH FOLDER A MOD ID ACTUALLY LIVES IN.
--
-- Reported from play: "experiencing issue for people that want to delete mods
-- or delete dramatic shapes, it says they're not installed but they appear in
-- the launcher as if it's installed".  Both halves were true at once, and the
-- reason is that a mod's ID and its FOLDER are two different names.
--
-- discover() lists a mod under the id its manifest declares and throws the
-- folder away; uninstall then went looking for "mods/<id>".  Those agree for
-- anything the launcher installed itself (installZip unzips to mods/<id>) and
-- routinely do not for anything unzipped by hand: DRAMATIC_SHAPE's manifest
-- declares `Gen2Recomped-DramaticShapes`, so the panel offered a row it could
-- not then find, and said so in the one wording that reads as nonsense next to
-- a visible row -- "not installed".
--
-- A folder whose name IS the id still wins first, so nothing the launcher put
-- there changes path; only a mismatch pays for the scan.
--
-- ...BUT THE FAST PATH HAS TO PROVE ITSELF, and that is the second half of the
-- same confusion.  Reported from play: with DRAMATIC_SHAPE installed, another
-- author's mod would not install at all -- "a mod named 'Dramatic_shape' is
-- already installed" -- for a mod that was not this one and had never been
-- installed.
--
-- `getInfo("mods/Dramatic_shape")` answered TRUE, because the folder on disk
-- is `mods/DRAMATIC_SHAPE` and Windows (and macOS by default) does not
-- distinguish the two.  So a folder belonging to somebody else was handed back
-- as this id's home, and the installer read that as "you already have this".
-- Two mods whose ids differ only in case are two mods, and one of them was
-- locked out of the machine by the other's folder name.
--
-- Reading the manifest costs one small file on the path that used to cost
-- nothing, and only for a hit -- a miss still falls straight through to the
-- scan below, which has always confirmed the id.
