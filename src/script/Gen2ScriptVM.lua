-- The Gen2 script VM.
--
-- data/generated/map_scripts.lua holds the ROM's own bytecode, disassembled by
-- src/import/RomExtractorGen2.lua: one flat pool of scripts keyed by
-- S<bank>_<addr>, one pool of applymovement data keyed by M<bank>_<addr>, and
-- a per-map index of scenes, callbacks, coord events and object scripts.
--
-- compile() lowers a script and everything it can reach into a single
-- ScriptRunner row list.  Because the ROM's `scall` is a real call, the lowered
-- form keeps a return stack (g2_call / g2_return in Gen2Commands) rather than
-- inlining, so a shared subroutine appears once no matter how many callers it
-- has.
--
-- Anything the port has no equivalent for lowers to nothing at all: an
-- unrecognised command is skipped, which degrades a scene rather than killing
-- the script.  register() therefore attaches these as *base* contributions,
-- behind the hand-ported data/scripts/ modules, which still win outright.

-- ScriptCheckCondition (engine/script_conditionals.asm) sets carry when the
-- guarded body should RUN, and the six are six genuinely different tests:
--
--   .false        ld a, c / cp 1     -- runs when the variable is ZERO

--
-- POLISHED CRYSTAL NAMES MOST OF ITS SPECIALS `Special_<X>` OR `Special<X>`,
-- and every table below is keyed on `<X>` -- which is what Gold, Silver and
-- Crystal call the same routine.  The extractor resolves a special's index by
-- following the SpecialsPointers row (`db bank, dw address`) to the routine
-- it points at and naming THAT, so what arrives here is the routine's own
-- label, prefix and all.
--
-- Measured against the cartridge itself: of the 160 rows its table names, 70
-- matched a key outright and 25 more differ from one by nothing but that
-- prefix -- SpecialNameRater, SpecialSnorlaxAwake, SpecialBuenasPassword,
-- SpecialBeastsCheck, the Ho-Oh and Omanyte chambers, Bill's grandfather, the
-- four lucky-number routines, both DST flags, SurfStartStep and the Bug
-- Contest contestant draw.  Falling through to `g2_special` does not just
-- skip them: it leaves wScriptVar holding whatever the previous row put
-- there, so a special standing between a check and its `iftrue` flips the
-- branch.
--
-- The trailing `Special` comes off as well, for a cartridge whose table
-- labels the ROW rather than the routine (`add_special X` emits `XSpecial::`
-- over the row, and this build does that too -- all 160 rows carry such a
-- label).  The extractor prefers the shortest symbol at the TARGET address,
-- so that spelling does not reach here on this build; it costs nothing and
-- the two rules compose for one that does.
--
-- THE EXACT KEY IS ALWAYS TRIED FIRST, so nothing that resolves today can
-- start resolving to something else; this only changes what happens after a
-- miss.  Checked: every key in the three tables still maps to itself, so Gold,
-- Silver, Crystal and Prism are untouched.  The 65 that remain are genuinely

-- Wonder Trade, the maniac price checks -- and stay in the audit.
