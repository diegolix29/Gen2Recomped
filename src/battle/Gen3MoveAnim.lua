-- EMERALD'S MOVE ANIMATIONS, as far as the cartridge can be read.
--
-- Reported from play: "when i use slash im not seeing the animation fx of the
-- move slash on the enemy pokemon".  Hoenn's battles played a sound and drew
-- nothing at all, because a Gen 3 move animation is a BYTECODE PROGRAM and
-- this port had never run one.
--
-- WHAT THE IMPORT HANDS OVER.  Each move carries `anim.events`: one record
-- per `createsprite` in its script, saying WHICH sheet the particle comes
-- from, WHICH battler it belongs over, WHAT pixel offset from that battler,
-- and AT WHICH FRAME of the script it appears.  All four are read straight
-- off the cartridge -- the tag and the frame size come from the sprite
-- template the command names, the battler from where Cmd_createsprite spawns
-- the sprite, and the moment from the `delay` commands in front of it.
--
-- WHICH BATTLER, AND THE BIT THAT DOES NOT SAY.  Reported from play: "when an
-- enemy pokemon attacks me the attack animation shows on itself rather than
-- me".  This used to read bit 7 of createsprite's battler byte --
-- ANIMSPRITE_IS_TARGET -- as "over the defender", which is what a bit of that
-- name sounds like and not what the cartridge does with it: Cmd_createsprite
-- reads the bit only to choose whose subpriority the sprite borrows, and then
-- spawns it at GetBattlerSpriteCoord(gBattleAnimTarget, ...) in both arms.
-- Every particle in the game spawns on the TARGET, and a self-aimed move has
-- gBattleAnimTarget pointing back at the user, which is how SWORDS DANCE
-- plays on the mon that danced.  So the import answers from the move's own
-- target field and this file just draws where it is told.
--
-- AND WHAT IT CANNOT.  Where a particle GOES after it is spawned is a C
-- function in the cartridge -- AnimSlashSlice, AnimEllipticalGust, four
-- hundred more -- and a retail ROM ships no symbol table to tell one from
-- another.  So this plays the move's own art, on the right Pokemon, at the
-- right offset, at the right moment, cycling the sheet's own frames; it does
-- not fly a particle along a path nobody can name.  Slash slashes.  Ember
-- burns on the target.  A move whose whole animation is one task function is
-- still quiet, and the record says so by carrying no events.
--
-- THE COORDINATE MIRROR: a script's offsets are authored from the far side
-- of the field, so an x offset on the PLAYER'S own Pokemon is negated -- the
-- cartridge does the same thing in GetBattlerSpriteCoord, and without it
-- every particle on your own mon leans the wrong way.

-- HOW LONG ONE PARTICLE STAYS UP, AND HOW ITS OWN PICTURE IS TIMED.
--
-- Reported from play: "some arent animating properly as they would on the
-- rom".  Every particle used to riffle its whole sheet at a flat six frames
-- an image and vanish after a flat twenty-six, because those were the two
-- numbers that had to be invented.  Only one of them still is.
--
-- The sprite template names an ANIMATION -- a run of ANIMCMD_FRAMEs, each an
-- image and the number of frames to hold it, ending in END, JUMP or LOOP --
-- and the import now reads it (RomExtractorGen3:spriteAnimTimeline).  Eighty
-- six of the hundred and eighty sheets carry one, and where a sheet does the
-- picture is timed to the cartridge's own numbers rather than to a guess:
-- SLASH's slice is four images of four frames and then it is over; EMBER's
-- flame holds each of three for four and repeats.
--
-- A timeline that ENDS is the particle's whole life -- the sprite plays its
-- animation and the callback destroys it -- so a move whose art ends is over
-- when its art is.  A timeline that REPEATS says nothing about when the
-- sprite goes, because that is in the callback, so those keep the guess.

-- them out, and that task is the part that cannot be read -- so drawn where
-- the script says, five flames are one flame.  Identical spawns are placed
-- around a small ring instead, in the order the script makes them.
--
-- THIS IS PRESENTATION, not a reading, and it is deliberately the only one:
-- it moves nothing that the script itself placed, and a move whose particles
-- already have distinct offsets -- PETAL DANCE, THUNDER, SWIFT -- is drawn
-- exactly where it says.

-- THE MON THAT FLINCHES.
--
-- The other half of a Gen 3 move animation is `createvisualtask`, and the C
-- functions those name are the part a retail dump cannot identify -- so no
-- Pokemon in Hoenn ever moved when it was hit.  One of those functions can be
-- had without a name: 157 task calls across 111 moves share one argument
-- shape, held for every call the five functions concerned make (see the
-- import's shake pass), and it is AnimTask_ShakeMon's -- a battler, a pixel
-- offset, a count and a delay.
--
-- HOW LONG IT SWINGS FOR, and the one number here that is a reading rather
-- than a value.  The task's setup writes the offset onto the sprite BEFORE
-- its step function ever runs, so the mon is displaced on the frame the task
-- starts rather than a delay later -- which is also what makes a flinch land
-- on the frame the hit does.  Its step then toggles between the offset and
-- home every `delay + 1` frames, and `count` is spent one per TOGGLE.
--
-- Counting it per out-and-back instead would double every one of these, and
-- the cartridge's own numbers say not to: PSYCHO BOOST asks for 240 and MIST
-- BALL for 70, which at two frames a swing is four seconds of juddering and
-- at one is two.  The scripts' own delay totals agree with the shorter
-- reading as far as they go -- they are a floor rather than a measure, since
-- a script that ends in `waitforvisualfinish` states no delay at all.
