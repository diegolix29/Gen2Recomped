-- src/battle/Gen4Battle.lua -- WHERE A SINNOH BATTLE HAPPENS.
--
-- Platinum's battle screen does not exist in this engine yet: `src/battle/`
-- has BattleState, Damage, Gen3Battle and the rulesets, and BattleState has a
-- Gen 3 layout arm and nothing for Gen 4, so a Platinum fight runs on the GAME
-- BOY screen -- name-and-level boxes, the two-panel FIGHT menu, blank paper.
--
-- This file answers three things: WHICH BACKGROUND AND WHICH TWO PLATFORMS
-- this battle is fought on, WHERE EVERYTHING STANDS, and -- as of this pass --
-- it DRAWS the field and the two battlers. Every number is read out of
-- pokeplatinum and, where two tables state the same thing, checked against
-- both.
--
-- WHAT IS STILL THE ENGINE'S OWN, AND SAID HERE SO IT IS NOT MISTAKEN FOR
-- PLATINUM'S: the text/menu area, and the two GAUGE BARS inside a healthbox.
-- The healthbox FRAME is Platinum's now -- see the healthbox block below for
-- where its size and origin come from -- and the name, level and HP read out of
-- the battler. The HP and EXP bars are not drawn yet, for a reason given there.
--
-- THE PLATFORM POSITIONS ARE NOT THE SPRITE TEMPLATES, which is the trap this
-- file exists to have already walked into. `sTerrainSpriteTemplates`
-- (terrain.c) says `{x = 336, y = 136}` for the player's side and
-- `{x = -80, y = 88}` for the foe's -- on a 256-pixel screen, both entirely
-- OFF it. Those are the off-screen START of the intro slide. The settled
-- positions are set outright in `battle_display.c`:
--
--     ManagedSprite_SetPositionXY(terrain, 24 * 8, 8 * 11)   -- enemy (192, 88)
--     ManagedSprite_SetPositionXY(terrain, 64, 128 + 8)      -- player (64, 136)
--
-- and the two agree in a way that could not be a coincidence: the y values are
-- IDENTICAL to the templates' (only x slides), and both sides travel exactly
-- 34 steps of 8 pixels -- (336 - 64) / 8 and (192 - -80) / 8. That symmetry is
-- what says the reading is right, and `tools/gen4_battlescene_check.lua`
-- asserts it rather than leaving it as a remark.

-- and only the enemy -- the player's back sprite looked planted.
--
-- Every battle sprite is an 80x80 frame and the Pokemon does not fill it.
-- MEASURED on the extracted PNGs: Piplup's front has 23 empty rows under it,
-- Starly's 20, and Chimchar's BACK only 8.  Drawn centred on the frame, a
-- front sprite's visible feet therefore land about fifteen pixels higher than
-- a back sprite's -- which is the gap, and why it showed on one side only.
--
-- THE CARTRIDGE STATES THE CORRECTION and the port already extracts it:
-- `BoxPokemon_SpriteYOffset` reads `poketool/pokegra/height.narc`, and the
-- import writes it as `gen4_species_sprites.species[id].frontOffset` /
-- `.backOffset`.  NOTHING IN `src/` HAD EVER READ EITHER.
--

-- rather than a nudge: the cartridge's offset for Piplup is 23 and its PNG has
-- 23 empty rows; Starly 20 and 20; Chimchar's back 8 and 8.  Three species,
-- two independent sources, no discrepancy.
--
-- THE SIGN IS THE CARTRIDGE'S TOO.  `send_phase.c` positions with
-- `y = (100 - 20) + BoxPokemon_SpriteYOffset(...)` -- it ADDS, so a bigger
-- offset pushes the picture DOWN, which is what a mon with more empty space

--   layer with the new picture while that picture is also at the fade colour, and
--   then fades the effect palette back. So the field is simply BLACK underneath --
--   which the base group's tint quad has already drawn -- and this layer goes on
--   top opaquely, wearing its own tint.
--

-- (centre 58,36, so 6,4 to 122,68), and its player panel (136,104 to 208,128)
-- on Platinum's player box (centre 192,116, so 128,84 to 256,148). Both land
-- within a dozen pixels of the real thing, which is why a plain centring is
-- worth more here than a hand-placed guess.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE HEALTHBOXES
--
-- WHAT THE CELL BANKS SAY, decoded out of the cartridge rather than guessed:
-- `healthbox/short_cell` and `healthbox/tall_cell` are each ONE cell of TWO
-- 64x64 OAM squares side by side, so an assembled box is 128x64 -- and the two
-- differ ONLY in where their origin sits:
--
--     short_cell  (enemy, player doubles)  extent 128x64 at (-64, -28)
--     tall_cell   (player singles)         extent 128x64 at (-64, -32)
--
-- Those offsets are from the sprite CENTRE, which is what HEALTHBOX_POS holds,
-- so the top-left of a drawn box is centre + origin. The four-pixel difference
-- between them is the whole reason there are two banks.
--
-- THE SECOND OAM CONFIRMS THE TILE ORDER. It names tile 32, and Platinum's
-- mapping mode is 1, so an index steps two tiles: 32 x 2 = 64, i.e. the left
-- square is tiles 0..63 and the right 64..127. That is what says the blocks are
-- laid out sequentially rather than interleaved.
--
-- THE NAME WINDOW IS THE TOP-LEFT 64x16. `healthbox.c` writes it at
-- HEALTHBOX_NAME_WINDOW_OFFSET 0 and it is 8x2 blocks of 32 bytes -- 16 tiles,
-- starting at tile 0. With the order above, tiles 0..15 are the first two rows
-- of the left square.
--
-- THE TWO GAUGES ARE DELIBERATELY NOT DRAWN YET. Their positions are VRAM BYTE
-- OFFSETS (`sHPGaugeVRAMTransfer`, and 1632 / 3584 for the EXP bar) that have to
-- be turned into tiles and then into pixels, and while the arithmetic is
-- straightforward the step from tile number to screen position rests on the 1D
-- row-major layout above -- which the OAM corroborates but nothing SECOND states
-- outright. Every other number on this screen is stated twice. These are not,
-- and the thing that would settle them is looking at the assembled art, which
-- does not exist until the cell-bank fix has been through an import. So they
-- wait for that rather than being written down now and checked later.

-- the foe's box hangs off the LEFT EDGE OF THE SCREEN. Reported from play as
-- "theyre missing the pokemon names for the HUD ui" -- they were being drawn
-- at x = -4.
--
-- So the panel is MEASURED off the assembled art instead: the green field
-- (107, 115, 90) above the brown trough, which comes out as a clean rectangle
-- in each of the three boxes and at a consistent ~106 x 14. The three differ

-- WHERE EVERY NUMBER ON A HEALTHBOX SITS

-- !! AND A CORRECTION, BECAUSE THIS FILE PREVIOUSLY SAID SOMETHING FALSE.
-- It said the HP numbers were blitted from the parts blob as
-- HEALTHBOX_PART_NUMBERS_LEFT / _RIGHT / _SLASH "(healthbox.c 840-845)".
-- Those parts are at those lines and they are NOT the numbers: 840 is inside
-- `Healthbox_ToggleHPDisplayMode`, which switches on the box type and RETURNS
-- for anything but the two DOUBLES boxes -- it is the empty number FIELD that
-- swaps in where the bar was.  It also said DrawLevelNumber and DrawMaxHP use
-- FONT_SYSTEM "(1316, 1355)"; those two lines are the SAFARI BALL COUNTER.
-- Only the NICKNAME is set in the system face (1143).
--
-- Every number -- the level, the current HP, the max HP -- goes through
-- FontSpecialChars_DrawBattleScreenText off a 23-tile glyph strip.  See
-- src/import/Gen4SpecialChars.lua.
--
-- HOW THE POSITIONS WERE GOT.  Each drawer names a VRAM byte offset into the
-- box's own character data, and the box is two 64x64 OAM squares side by side
-- with tiles 0..63 in the left and 64..127 in the right (the cell bank says so;
-- see the healthbox section of docs/gen4-platinum.md).  So offset / 32 is a
-- tile index and the tile index is a position:
--
--     tile t < 64   -> ( (t % 8) * 8,       (t // 8) * 8 )
--     tile t >= 64  -> ( 64 + (u % 8) * 8,  (u // 8) * 8 )   u = t - 64
--
-- THREE THINGS CONFIRM IT, none of them the arithmetic itself:
--   * the level digits land at the RIGHT-HAND END of the green panel measured
--     for HEALTHBOX_PANEL -- 104..127 against a panel ending at 127 on the
--     solo box, 88..111 against one ending at 111 on the foe's;
--   * the current HP (64..87) and the max HP (96..119) leave EXACTLY ONE
--     eight-pixel column between them -- and the assembled box art has a
--     diagonal "/" baked into x 88..95, y 41..46.  The slash is in the
--     picture because it never changes; the numbers are not because they do;
--   * the HP row lands at y 40..47, inside the nine-row band this file had
--     already measured off the art for a different reason.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE TWO GAUGES
--
-- These waited a long time on purpose. Their positions in the cartridge are
-- VRAM BYTE OFFSETS (sHPGaugeVRAMTransfer) that would have to become tiles and
-- then pixels, and the tile-to-pixel step rests on a layout the OAM
-- corroborates but nothing states twice. Every other number on this screen is
-- stated twice, so rather than write these down and check them later they were
-- left undrawn until the assembled art existed to check against.
--
-- IT EXISTS NOW, AND THREE SOURCES AGREE.
--
--  MEASURED OFF THE ART. In all three boxes the brown trough runs y 31..38,
--  and inside it, on rows 35 and 36, there is a dark channel of exactly 48
--  pixels -- at x 72 (player singles), 56 (enemy) and 64 (player doubles). The
--  singles box alone carries a second groove, 96 pixels at row 50, x 24.
--
--  STATED IN THE CARTRIDGE. HEALTHBOX_HP_CELL_COUNT is 6 and
--  HEALTHBOX_EXP_CELL_COUNT is 12, and CalcGaugeFill's own comment says
--  "gauges have 8 pixels per 'square' of fill". 6 x 8 = 48. 12 x 8 = 96.
--
--  STATED AGAIN. sHPGaugeVRAMTransfer's two runs per box sum to 0xC0 bytes =
--  6 tiles, in the same { position, size } format the name window's own
--  transfers use.
--
-- AND THEN THE ALIGNMENT PROVED ITSELF. The gauge is a tile substitution in the
-- healthbox sprite's character data, so it MUST fall on the box's own 8x8 grid.
-- The parts tile puts the HP bar on its rows 3-4 and the EXP bar on its row 2,
-- so the tiles' tops land at box rows 35-3 = 32 and 50-2 = 48. THOSE ARE BOTH
-- MULTIPLES OF EIGHT, and so are all three HP x's and the EXP x. Six
-- measurements taken off a picture with no knowledge of that constraint, and
-- all six satisfy it.
Gen4Battle.GAUGE_HP = {
  healthbox_player_singles = { x = 72, y = 32 },
  healthbox_enemy          = { x = 56, y = 32 },

--

-- chosen from the fill BELOW, twelve lines after the guard had already
-- returned.  So the HP bar never drew, on any box, in any battle, while the
-- EXP bar beside it worked -- and `drawGauges` is called inside a `pcall`, so
-- nothing said anything either.

-- THE MENUS, DRAWN FROM PLATINUM'S OWN BUTTONS
--
-- From the brief: *"for the two screen mode, when the bottom screen is up show
-- the fight run bag and pokemon buttons on there but when they have it put
-- away draw the button tiles next to the text box on the bottom of the screen
-- in the same art style but fit to the text boxes size"*.
--
-- So there are two presentations of one menu, and they share their art:
--
--   BOTTOM SCREEN UP    the cartridge's picture, untouched, at its own
--                       coordinates -- the base panel with the action layer
--                       over it, through src/ui/SecondScreen.lua.
--   PUT AWAY            the same four buttons NINE-SLICED into the message
--                       box's own strip, so they keep their colours, corners
--                       and bevel at a size that fits.
--
-- A DS'S BOTTOM SCREEN IS ON UNTIL YOU PUT IT AWAY, and a battle's menu is not
-- something the player opens -- it is where the menu lives until they say
-- otherwise. So this asks `SecondScreen.stowed`, the player's standing answer,
-- and NOT `raised`.
--
-- !! THOSE TWO ARE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS AND FOLDING THEM COST A REAL BUG.
-- `raised` is transient and belongs to whatever is on the bottom surface right
-- now: the Poketch sets it on open and clears it on close. Reading it here
-- meant that a player who had looked at the Poketch once in the field left it
-- false behind them, and every battle afterwards came up with its menu stowed
-- for no reason they could see -- with no way back, because nothing in a

-- WHERE THE COMPACT BUTTONS GO, and the split between what is derived and what
-- is this port's.
--
-- DERIVED -- the HORIZONTAL layout is the cartridge's own, taken straight from
-- sActionMenuTouchRects: FIGHT spans the width, and underneath it BAG at
-- x 0..80, RUN at 88..168 and POKeMON at 176..255. Those columns are why the
-- strip reads as Platinum's even at a fifth of the height.
--
-- THE PORT'S -- the VERTICAL split. The cartridge gives FIGHT 71% of a
-- 168-pixel column; compressed into a strip that same share leaves the three
-- small buttons 15 to 18 pixels tall, and the dialogue face is SIXTEEN. So the
-- strip is halved instead, which is the one number here that was chosen rather
-- than read, and it is chosen for the only reason that matters at this size:
-- the words have to fit inside the buttons.
--
-- The strip is 64 pixels -- the bottom eight tile rows -- rather than the
-- message box's 48, because 48 halved is 24 and a 24-pixel button with a
-- 9-pixel corner at each end has six pixels of middle. It reaches one tile row
-- above the box's frame, over field that is empty backdrop while a menu is up.
--
-- !! AND IT WAS SIXTEEN PIXELS TOO HIGH AND SIXTEEN TOO TALL.
--
-- Reported from play: *"this is a little too tall, it should sit under the
-- players pokemons hp hud"*. It was `{ y = 128, h = 64 }` -- y 128..192 -- and
-- the player's solo healthbox is 128x64 drawn at (128, 84), so the two
-- overlapped by twenty pixels and the FIGHT button sat across the bottom of the
-- box.
--
-- MEASURED, off the assembled art rather than guessed: the player's singles box
-- is opaque on rows 11..52 of its 64, so on screen its plaque ends at
-- 84 + 52 = 136. And the strip has somewhere exact to go -- Platinum's own
-- message box is the full width of the screen at y 144..192
-- (MESSAGE_BOX above, and the frame arithmetic beside it). That is the one band
-- of this screen the cartridge already gives to the interface, it is 48 pixels
-- deep, and it clears the healthbox by eight.
--
-- So the strip IS the message box's band. Two rows of 24 rather than two of 32,
-- which is also what stops the buttons looking like a second HUD.

-- row, then ITEM, RUN, PARTY beneath it. Walking a 2x2 over a 1+3 layout is why
-- the cursor jumped about.
--
-- THE REMEMBERED COLUMN IS WHAT MAKES IT SMOOTH. FIGHT spans all three columns,

--
-- THE ARCHIVE THIS PORT EXTRACTED FOR THIS IS THE WRONG ONE, and that is worth
-- writing down because it cost a pass.  `ball_particle.narc`'s 117 effects are
-- the BALL CAPSULE SEALS: pokeplatinum opens that NARC in exactly one place,
-- `ov12_02235E94.c`, from `BallCapsuleSealEffect`, and nowhere else.  The throw
-- is not a particle effect at all -- it is a 2D cell animation out of
-- `pl_batt_obj`, the archive this file already describes.
