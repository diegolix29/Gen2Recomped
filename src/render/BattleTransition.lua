-- Delay3 after EnableLCD 3 -- and then noted that the two sprite
-- decompressors (UncompressSpriteFromDE for the 7x7 front pic,
-- LoadPlayerBackPic's uncompress + ScaleSpriteByTwo) are bit-level RLE/delta
-- decoders whose cost cannot be cycle-counted from the asm at all.  So the
-- derivation bottoms out around 25-30 with an unbounded remainder, and 60
-- was set by ear against the real ROM ("a solid second") and confirmed as
-- ~95% right rather than frame-matched.  The credible range is 30-60; do NOT

-- HOENN'S OWN WIPES
--
-- Reported from play: "also seem to be missing a lot of the battle
-- transitions from emerald that play when you start a wild encounter or
-- trainer battle".  They were missing, and deliberately: the pair above this
-- are FADES, because a fade is the one shape that ports exactly, and the note
-- there says the showier ones "are a feature rather than a fix".  This is
-- that feature.
--
-- WHAT THESE ARE AND ARE NOT.  Emerald's transitions are scanline and palette
-- tricks -- a real slice shears the BG registers line by line, a real ripple
-- is a sine table written into BGHOFS every scanline.  This engine composites
-- whole frames, so none of those can be replayed literally.  What CAN be
-- replayed is the FIGURE each one draws: the order the screen goes dark in.
-- That is what the wipe machinery already expresses -- a walk over the tile
-- grid -- and it is why the Game Boy's eight look right here at any window
-- size.  So each of these is Emerald's figure on this engine's wipe, and the
-- name says which cartridge transition it is standing in for.
--
-- Every one is written against an arbitrary cols x rows grid rather than
-- against 20x18, so they are continuous out through the letterbox like the
-- rest (see Renderer:drawBattleWipe).

-- B_TRANSITION_GRID_SQUARES: the screen breaks up into squares rather than
-- being swept.  An ordered (Bayer) threshold is the honest way to write that
-- as a walk -- it scatters without being random, so it looks the same every
