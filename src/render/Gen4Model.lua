-- Drawing a Gen 4 model, which is the first real 3D this engine does itself.
--
-- The voxel mod has its own 3D and the tilt ground quad is one mesh with one
-- shader, but the engine core has never had a general "here is a mesh, draw
-- it" path -- so Platinum's 590 buildings, Giratina on the title, the field
-- effects and Professor Rowan's briefcase all had geometry sitting in the
-- cache with nothing able to put it on screen.
--
-- THIS IS DELIBERATELY SELF-CONTAINED.  It does not register a pipeline, does
-- not touch the world pass, and does not ask the Renderer for anything: a
-- screen creates one of these, draws it into its own canvas, and throws it
-- away.  The reason is that the first thing to use it is the starter select --
-- a menu with three Poke Balls in a briefcase -- which has no world behind it
-- and no business being part of the world's pipeline.  When the map meshes
-- arrive they will want the pipeline; a menu does not, and building for the
-- harder case first would mean neither worked.
--
-- WHAT DEPTH COSTS.  A 3D scene needs a depth buffer, which means a canvas
-- created with one and `setDepthMode` around the draw.  Both are restored
-- afterwards, unconditionally, because this runs inside somebody else's draw
-- and leaving either set turns the next 2D blit into a puzzle.

local Assets = require("src.render.Assets")
local Logger = require("src.core.Logger")
-- The pose walk lives with the reader that produced the bytecode.  Requiring
-- an importer from a renderer is not pretty; having the same walk written
-- twice and drifting apart would be worse, and this is the walk that decides
-- where every shape stands.

-- Matches Gen4ModelPack: a vertex is fourteen bytes and a coordinate is fx16.
-- 16, not 14: the last three bytes are the normal, as three signed bytes.
--
-- Platinum's display lists issue NORMAL and no COLOR -- the DS lights in
-- hardware -- so a vertex whose normal was dropped in packing keeps the
-- decoder's white default, and every polygon draws with no directional term.
-- That is what made the whole of Sinnoh read flat under a correct camera.
local VERTEX_BYTES = 16

-- The vertex shader takes a model-view-projection matrix and nothing else.
--
-- `TransformProjectionMatrix` is LOVE's own 2D transform and is deliberately
-- ignored: the whole point here is to put clip-space coordinates out directly,
-- and mixing the two would apply the 2D camera to a 3D scene.
-- ...AND A TEXTURE TRANSFORM, which is what a Gen 4 texture animation is.
--
-- `bm_anime`'s BTA0 animations scroll, scale and rotate a material's texture
-- coordinates -- that is how Platinum's water moves and its fountains run.
-- THE UNITS ARE NORMALISED, measured rather than assumed: every scroll in that
-- archive runs its translate from 0.0 to exactly -1.0 over its own frame count
-- (the waterfall to -2.0, which is two cycles in the same time) with scale held
-- at 1.0.  A translate that lands on whole units is one full wrap of the
-- texture; texel units would have run to 16 or 64 and do not.
--
-- This port's UVs are already divided by the texture's size when the mesh is
-- built, so the transform applies directly with nothing to convert.
--
-- Two vectors rather than a mat3 because a 2x2 and an offset is all a texture
-- SRT is, and because every shape sends them on every draw -- including the
-- overwhelming majority that are identity.  Sending them ALWAYS is deliberate:
-- a uniform that is declared and not sent reads as zero, and a zero texture
-- matrix collapses every coordinate to one texel, which is a model drawn in a
-- single flat colour.
-- `yCut` IS WHAT MAKES WALK-BEHIND POSSIBLE.
--
-- Every fragment carries the model-space height it came from, and the pixel
-- stage drops the ones at or below the cut.  Drawing a building twice -- once
-- whole, under the sprites, and once with everything below head height cut
-- away, over them -- is what lets a character pass BEHIND a house: the roof
-- and upper walls are painted after the sprite, the ground floor is not, and
-- somebody standing in front of the door is still drawn in front of it.
--
-- The default is a number no geometry reaches, so a caller that does not ask
-- for a cut gets the whole model.  It is SENT ON EVERY DRAW rather than left
-- unset, because an unset uniform reads as zero and zero would quietly cut
-- every model in the game off at the waist.

-- and 8-vertex boxes -- but the FLAT quads are the sea, the lakes and the
-- grass floor, and standing those on end would take the world apart.
--

-- four vertices.
-- HOW MANY TIMES A CARD REPEATS ITS TEXTURE ACROSS ITS WIDTH, above which it
-- is a CONTINUOUS STRIP and not a tree.
--
-- Reported from play, twice: *"the border trees ... rotating as a large group
-- of trees instead of individually above their trunks"*, and again after the
-- pivot was moved to the base -- *"many groups of trees canopys are still
-- pivoting as if theyre rows rather than from the trunk of every tree"*.
--
-- The second report is not a pivot fault.  Measured: 100% of card components
-- are exactly one quad, so nothing is being merged.  What IS happening is that
-- Platinum draws a forest border as ONE CARD -- `conttree` is *continuous*
-- tree -- 256 world units wide and 20 tall, repeating a 64-pixel texture four
-- times.  All 2,956 `conttree_t` cards and all 3,738 `conttree2_t` cards are
-- wider than 48 units; the widest are 256.  A quad cannot bend, so there is no
-- pivot that turns those four trees individually: the geometry for them does
-- not exist.
--
-- SUBDIVIDING THEM WAS TRIED AND ABANDONED.  Splitting a strip at its texture
-- tiles needs the repeat count to be a whole number, and across the cartridge
-- **23,171 of 30,147 cards have a non-integer u-span over texture width** --
-- the UVs address sub-rectangles, not whole tiles. There is no derivable place
-- to cut, and cutting at a guessed one would break a strip into panels that
-- swing apart at the seams.
--
-- So a strip is left exactly as the cartridge drew it, which is what it was
-- authored for, and only cards that really are one tree turn to face you.

-- strip it is.

-- for example 3 trees are pivoting from one point"*.
--
-- Measured over all 666 chunks of the cartridge, u-span divided by texture
-- width lands on clean values -- and 2,396 components sit at EXACTLY 1.50:
--
--     0.66 x6328   0.53 x6279   0.34 x6272     <- single trees
--     4.00 x3534 (excluded)   2.50 x1187 (excluded)   2.00 x1159 (excluded)
--     1.50 x2396   <- ON the old threshold, and the test is `>`, so KEPT
--     1.00 x2250   <- a single tree, correctly kept
--
-- A strict `>` against 1.5 lets every one of those 2,396 through, and at a
-- 64-wide texture that component is 96 world units across: THREE 32-unit
-- trees turning about one pivot, which is the report word for word.
--
-- 1.25 rather than 1.4 or 1.49 because it is the MIDDLE OF A MEASURED GAP:
-- 21,758 components are at or under 1.00 repeats, 2,396 are at 1.50, and
-- only EIGHTEEN of 30,147 lie strictly between the two.  A threshold in an
-- empty gap cannot be knocked over by float wobble in the s16 divide, which
-- is exactly what setting it on 1.5 and testing with `>=` would risk.

-- ...AND A `conttree` IS NEVER ONE TREE, WHICH THE CARTRIDGE SAYS IN THE NAME.
--
-- `conttree` is CONTINUOUS tree.  The u-span test is a proxy -- it reads the
-- texture's repeat, not the quad's size -- and it misses the strips whose UVs
-- are stretched rather than tiled.  The name does not miss them, and the
-- separation is total:
--
--     conttree* components   n=10,217  min width 64.0  median 128  max 256
--                            AT OR UNDER 40 UNITS: ZERO
--     every other component  n=19,930  median 33      98.3% at or under 40
--
-- The narrowest `conttree` in the game is 64 units, which is already two
-- trees; an ordinary tree card is 33.  There is no overlap to argue about.
--
-- Effect, measured: billboarded cards wider than 48 units fall from 4,493
-- (18.6% of all cards) to 51 (0.3%), and the widest from 96.0 to 85.3.  The
-- name rule alone does most of it -- 18.6% to 0.4% -- and the threshold trims

  -- to be rotating billboards weird as a large group of trees instead of
  -- individually above their trunks"*.
  --
  -- The first version pivoted on the component's CENTROID, and a leaning card's
  -- centroid is not above its base -- the cartridge tilts them 35 degrees back,
  -- so the middle of the quad hangs behind the trunk.  Measured on Twinleaf's
  -- own border: every `conttree_b` card's centroid is 13.9 units behind its
  -- base and every `conttree_t` card's is 9.0 to 12.3.  Turning each about that
  -- point swings it through an arc it never should have left, which reads as
  -- the whole tree line sweeping sideways -- and because the trunk's offset
  -- (13.9) and the canopy's (12.3) DIFFER, the two halves of one tree come
  -- apart as they turn.
  --
  -- So the pivot is the middle of the card's LOWEST edge: the line where it
  -- meets the ground, which is the trunk. A trunk and the canopy above it
  -- share that axis even though they are separate components, so they stay
  -- together.
  -- A CONTINUOUS STRIP IS NOT A TREE -- see `STRIP_REPEATS` above.

-- THE GRASS A WILD POKEMON LIVES IN, STOOD UP
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- Requested: *"make the grass billboards that stand up and always face the
-- camera"*, and then, when the first attempt stood up the wrong layer,
-- *"looks like your making the wrong grass a billboard its supposed to be the
-- grass wild pokemon are in"*.
--
-- WHICH LAYER, and why a name is the right way to ask.  Sinnoh's ground is
-- drawn in layers, each its own polygon with its own material, and the
-- cartridge separates the lawn from the encounter grass exactly that way:
-- `ngrass` against `nectgr`.  The renderer cannot ask the other question --
-- "is this tile TALL_GRASS" -- because the behaviour byte is a movement-layer
-- fact that the terrain cache does not carry; it holds geometry and height and
-- nothing else.  So the material is the question that can be asked here, and
-- it is the cartridge's own answer rather than a guess about one.
--
-- MEASURED, ON THE ART, why the lawn must not be in this list.  Every ground
-- tile in the set is 100% opaque -- there is no cut-out anywhere -- so a card
-- made from one is a solid rectangle, and what decides whether that reads as
-- grass is how much of the tile is decoration rather than flat field colour.
-- `ngrass` is 57.4% one flat green over four colours; `nectgr` is 21.1% flat
-- over nine, the rest leaf. Stood up, the first is a green slab that blanks
-- out the path behind it and the second is a clump of leaves.
--
-- The list is names because only names are available, and it is one table so
-- that importing another region's texture set is a one-line change. Only the
-- materials that have actually been LOOKED at are in it.
--
-- THE OTHER GRASS-ISH NAMES, now that they ARE extracted -- the note that used
-- to sit here said they were not, and that stopped being true some imports ago.
-- Census over all 666 land chunks, then each texture opened and viewed:
--
--   `ngrass` (224 shapes) -- OUT. The lawn: 4 colours, 86.7% one flat green,
--     border 100%. Stood up it is a slab that blanks the path behind it.
--   `bf_ngrass` (9) -- OUT, and it is the same thing under another area's
--     prefix: 8 colours, 66.4% flat, border 90.6%, and it looks like a lawn.
--   `l_grass_u` / `_m` / `_d` (16 between them) -- OUT, and this one is worth
--     the sentence: stacked u-m-d they form ONE CONTINUOUS COLUMN of grass
--     blades three tiles tall, with the ground band at the foot of `_d`. That
--     is grass the cartridge ALREADY DRAWS STANDING, on a vertical face.
--     Standing it again would double it, and there is nothing to cut out --
--     the blades run edge to edge, which is why their border agreement is
--     12-23% against `nectgr`'s 85.9%.
--   `s_grass` (20) -- IN. A dark spiky clump on red soil: 10 colours, 41.4%
--     flat, border 67.2%. Structurally the same picture as `nectgr` -- a plant
--     with a uniform field colour around it -- which is exactly what the
--     cut-out below needs and what makes a card read as a clump.
--
--   `nectgr` (97) -- IN, the original: 8 colours, 32.8% flat, border 85.9%.
--
-- The `grow_*` singles and `gym04_daigrass02` are one shape each and have not
-- been looked at; one shape is not worth a card until someone has.

-- THE TILE'S BACKGROUND, CUT OUT.
--
-- A ground tile is opaque all the way across -- the whole set is, there is no

-- the plant reads as a clump inside a visible pale box.
--
-- What that box is, is the GROUND: a tile has to meet the ground seamlessly on
-- all four sides, so the colour running round its border is the field it sits
-- in.  Measured on `nectgr`, 63.3% of the border is (82,255,148) and that is
-- also the tile's commonest colour overall at 21.1% -- the border and the whole
-- agree, which is what says it is a background and not a pattern.  On a
-- VERTICAL card that colour is behind the plant rather than under it, so it is
-- made transparent and the model shader's own alpha cut removes it.

-- this one, and it is derived from the cartridge's own pixels rather than

-- SPLITTING A WALL COURSE INTO ITS SIDING AND ITS GLASS
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- Reported from play: *"the houses have repeating window textures maybe just
-- do one window and fill the rest with the wood texture"*.
--
-- Correct, and the cause is that not every band is a course.  `t1_s01`'s wall
-- rect is 36 x 30 texels of siding-window-siding, and the cartridge puts it on
-- ONE quad per side wall -- a panel with a window in it, never repeated.
-- `t1_h01`'s rect really is a course and really does tile, twice per side wall
-- and mirrored.  Tiling both gives one right wall and one wall of windows.
--
-- WHAT SEPARATES THEM IS PURE WHITE.  Read off the two textures: `t1_h01`'s
-- band runs from 0.542 to 0.821 luminance and never touches white, while
-- `t1_s01`'s glass is exactly 1.000 against siding at 0.756 to 0.871.  Glass
-- is the only thing in a Platinum house wall drawn at the palette's white, and
-- a band with none in it is siding all the way across.
--
-- The FRAME around the glass is found without a second number: among the
-- columns that carry no white, the profile that occurs most often is the
-- siding (on `t1_s01`, ten columns of thirty-six), and the window block is
-- grown outward from the glass for as long as the next column is not that
-- profile.  That takes in the grey surround and the two courses beside it and
-- stops at the first real siding column -- exactly, with nothing tuned.

-- CLOSE A BUILDING'S MISSING BACK.
--
-- Requested: *"the backs of buildings are blank which is normal for the rom but
-- we should find a way to fill the back with a texture that fits in"*, and
-- later *"they should use textures from the building they are a part of so they
-- look natural"*.
--
-- The cartridge really does omit it -- the camera only ever looks north, so the
-- north face is never seen and was never modelled.  Measured on Twinleaf's own
-- house `t1_h01`: 158 triangles, **0 facing north**, against 50 south, 43 east,
-- 41 west and 24 up.  `c1_b02b` has 2 north against 96 south.
--
-- EDGE-LOOP CAPPING WAS THE PLAN AND IT DOES NOT WORK HERE.  Capping needs a
-- boundary loop, and this geometry has no boundary: `t1_h01` has **273 open
-- edges of 360** because the walls are separate quads that share no vertices.
-- There is no loop to walk.
--
-- So the back is built from the building's own WALLS instead: their outline
-- gives its shape, their outermost planes give its width and the plane it
-- stands on, and one of their faces gives the course it is tiled with.  Four
-- separate measurements, each with its own note below, and the whole point of
-- taking them from the walls is that a back built this way has no numbers of
-- its own to be wrong.
--
-- Right for a boxy house, which is what Sinnoh's are; an L-shaped building
-- gets a flat back across its extent rather than a fitted one, and that is the
-- honest limit of a single plane.
--
-- WHAT THIS COSTS, measured: with the back on, Twinleaf drawn at the cartridge
-- rung is pixel-identical to Twinleaf without it -- 0 differing pixels of
-- 307,200 -- and the third-person view from the FRONT differs by 21, while the
-- view from BEHIND differs by 15.7 per cent.  A control that changes nothing

  -- all: a gabled roof slopes down to the eaves, so a rectangle reaching the
  -- RIDGE height sticks out past the roof on both sides, and those corners
  -- showed as two red triangles over every house.
  --
  -- THE OUTLINE COMES FROM THE WALL TRIANGLES, NOT FROM WHOLE SHAPES.
  --
  -- Three separate adjustments -- inset the height, move to the wall line,
  -- shrink the box -- each moved the stray-pixel count by about ten, which is
  -- the signature of guessing at a cause rather than finding one.  The cause
  -- is that the ROOF overhangs the walls on every axis, so a silhouette that
  -- includes it puts a wall out under the eaves on all sides at once.
  --
  -- Excluding whole shapes whose faces mostly point up was the first attempt
  -- and it excludes nothing on the buildings that matter: `t1_h01` is ONE
  -- shape carrying its walls and its roof together.  `wallTris` lists the
  -- triangles that are not up- or down-facing, so the silhouette is the walls'
  -- and the gable end's -- which is exactly the outline a back should fill.
  -- NORTH IS -Z -- AND THE WALL LINE IS NOT THE BOX'S NORTH EDGE.
  --
  -- The box's north extent is the ROOF OVERHANG, which reaches further north
  -- than the walls do.  Placing the back there put it out under the eaves
  -- where the roof does not cover it, and it showed from the front as thin
  -- vertical slivers at each gable corner -- 259 stray pixels on a view that
  -- must not change.  Tucking it half a unit lower barely moved that (253),
  -- which is what said the fault was depth and not height.
  --
  -- Nor is it the SHAPE's north edge, which was the next guess and no better:
  -- `t1_h01` is one shape carrying its walls and its roof, so its north edge
  -- IS the overhang, at -22.00.
  --
  -- Nor is it the plane of the faces wearing the wall COURSE, which was the
  -- guess after that and is the one that shipped.  Reported from play:
  -- *"theyre a bit too far inside of the house rather than fitting on the
  -- back"*, and that is exactly right -- `t1_h01`'s chosen course is worn by
  -- two quads that stop at -13.75 while the walls carry on to -19.75, so the
  -- back stood six units inside its own house.  A course is a texture, and
  -- where a texture stops is not where a building stops.
  --
  -- It is the northmost WALL FACE: every triangle that is not up- or
  -- down-facing, which is the same set the silhouette is drawn from.  Measured
  -- over six buildings it agrees with the northmost east/west face every time
  -- and sits 1 to 3 units south of the bounding box -- the roof overhang,
  -- which is the one thing it has to exclude.
  -- ...AND IT IS NOT SIMPLY THE NORTHMOST WALL FACE EITHER.
  --
  -- `c1_b01a`'s northmost wall stands two units proud of the house and is a
  -- PLINTH: the cross-section there is eight triangles reaching 11.30 where
  -- the building is 102 tall, and a back drawn to it came out with no height
  -- and was dropped.  So the wall planes are tried from the north inward and
  -- the first one where the building is still at least half its own height is
  -- taken.  There is no slope to sit on: the rejected plane is 11 per cent of
  -- the height and the accepted one 96, while every other building measured
  -- passes at its very first plane at 100.

  -- The loop above sets `setColor(1, 1, 1, shapeAlpha(shape))` PER SHAPE, which
  -- is right -- a model mixes opaque walls with a translucent shadow. But the
  -- colour is global graphics state, so whatever the LAST shape asked for was
  -- still in force when this returned. `SpriteRenderer` sets no colour of its
  -- own; it inherits. So a character drawn after a chunk whose final shape was
  -- translucent was drawn AT THAT SHAPE'S ALPHA.
  --
  -- Indoors is where it showed worst because indoors is where those shapes are:
  -- `shade`, `stair_d01_shade`, `table01_1_shade` and `dun_shadow` all state
  -- 12/31, so a character came out at about 39% opacity -- which is exactly
  -- "see through" and not a depth or sorting fault at all.
  --
  -- THE OTHER THREE RESTORES WERE ALREADY HERE, which is what makes this an
  -- omission rather than a design: the function knew it was borrowing shared
  -- state and put back the cull mode, the depth mode and the shader. The
  -- `setColor(1, 1, 1, 1)` at the top of the loop is the same knowledge, said
  -- once at the wrong end.
  --
  -- AND IT PREDATES THE TERRAIN ALPHA WORK but was made much wider by it: the
  -- `kage` name fallback already gave 9/31 to kage-named shapes, so this bit
  -- wherever a model happened to end on one -- Rowan's room. Carrying the
  -- cartridge's real alpha for 155 materials turned a few rooms into most of
  -- them.
