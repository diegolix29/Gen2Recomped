-- SINNOH, DRAWN.
--
-- Platinum has no tileset: its world is 666 land chunks, each a 32 x 32 tile
-- square carrying an NSBMD mesh and a texture set named by the map's own area
-- record. The import stage puts all of that in the cache (see Gen4Terrain);
-- this is what turns it into pixels, and it replaces `TILESET_GEN4_STANDIN` --
-- one flat colour per terrain class, which is a legible plan of a map and is
-- not Sinnoh.
--
-- A CHUNK IS BAKED ONCE, TOP-DOWN, INTO A CANVAS, and the canvas is what the
-- map draws. That is not a shortcut around a 3D view; it is the same thing
-- `Gen3Tiles` already does with its metatile sheets, for the same reason: the
-- geometry does not change, so rasterising it every frame is work done over
-- and over to arrive at the same 512 x 512 picture. When a real camera exists
-- the meshes are already here and this becomes the flat case of it.
--
-- ONE PIXEL PER WORLD UNIT, which is what makes everything else line up: a
-- tile is 16 units and the engine draws tiles at 16 pixels, so the collision
-- grid, the warps and the sprites land on the ground without a second scale to
-- keep in step.
--
-- THE PROJECTION IS ORTHOGRAPHIC AND THE CHUNK'S ORIGIN IS ITS CENTRE.
-- `posScale` is 32 and a chunk's vertices run about -8..+8, so it spans
-- -256..+256 of its 512-unit square -- read as 0..512 seven eighths of the
-- mesh falls off the edge, which looks like a broken decoder and is
-- arithmetic. World +z is south, and a chunk bakes into a CANVAS, where clip
-- y counts the other way round -- see `topDown` for the whole of it.

-- How many baked chunks to keep. Each is a 512 x 512 canvas -- a megabyte of
-- colour and its depth buffer -- and a screen shows at most four, so this is
-- room to walk about in without rebaking and a bounded cost.
Gen4Ground.CACHE = 16

-- How many chunks may bake in one frame.
--
-- One was too few: a screen shows up to four, a map entry needs all of them,
-- and at one a frame the other three showed the stand-in for three frames --
-- which with the old early-return showed nothing at all. Four is the whole
-- visible set, so a map entry pays one hitch and then nothing; walking into a
-- new chunk pays for that one.
Gen4Ground.BAKES_PER_FRAME = 4

-- The depth range the height is mapped into, and it is a PRECISION choice
-- rather than a safety margin.
--
-- Four thousand was the first guess and it spent almost all of the depth
-- buffer on heights that do not occur: a chunk's own geometry spans tens of
-- units, so two nearly coplanar surfaces -- a floor and the mat on it -- came
-- out a couple of millionths apart in clip space and fought, which reads on
-- screen as alternating rows of one surface and the other. A thousand and
-- twenty-four still clears anything in the cartridge (Mount Coronet is
-- hundreds) and gives four times the resolution to tell them apart.
local DEPTH_RANGE = 1024

-- An orthographic top-down matrix, in the same row-major layout
-- `Gen4Model.perspective` returns.
--
-- CLIP Y COUNTS THE OTHER WAY INTO A CANVAS, and this row used to be -1/half,
-- which baked EVERY CHUNK IN SINNOH UPSIDE DOWN.  Reported from play as "the
-- map ... seems like its upside down and maps arent properly aligned nor
-- walkable areas", and the second half of that sentence is the first half's
-- consequence: the collision grid was never flipped, so a house you could see
-- at the bottom of the screen had its walls at the top and its door on the
-- wrong side of it.
--
-- `Gen4Title` already carries this trap written up -- "Giratina is showing ...
-- upside down" -- and its `FLIP_Y`; a custom `position()` returns clip
-- coordinates directly and so bypasses the projection LOVE would set up for
-- the target, and a canvas's framebuffer counts its rows the opposite way from
-- the screen.  This file was written without that compensation.
--
-- MEASURED RATHER THAN EYEBALLED, on Twinleaf Town (T01, matrix 0, chunk cell
-- 3,27):
--
--   * the four houses' collision footprints are 5x5 at the top-left and
--     bottom-right and 4x4 at the top-right and bottom-left; the baked picture
--     had the 5x5 pair at bottom-left and top-right -- mirrored
--   * all four of the map's warps sit on the BOTTOM row of their own house's
--     footprint, which is where a door is; the door model (build_model 67,
--     placed four times) sits at z = house z + 13, so +z is south in the
--     grid's terms as well as the cartridge's
--   * `Gen4Ground:heightsAt` already reads tile y as +z, so the height lookup
--     and the picture disagreed about which way south was
--   * the asymmetric gaps in the town's border (rows 1-2 only, never rows
--     29-30) rendered at the bottom of the screen
--
-- A vertical flip also reverses triangle winding.  That costs nothing here
-- because `Gen4Model:draw` sets cull mode "none"; if culling is ever turned on
-- for the ground, the winding has to be reversed with it.
--
-- AND IT IS NO LONGER STRAIGHT DOWN.  `Gen4Camera` carries Platinum's own
-- seventeen field cameras; every one of them is TILTED, between 40.6 and 78.4
-- degrees, and the map header says which.  This projects at that pitch as an
-- OBLIQUE camera:
--
--   screenX = x                       screenY = z - y * cot(pitch)
--
-- so the ground plane still maps one to one -- the tile grid, the collision
-- and every sprite stay exactly where they were, and nothing above this file
-- has to change -- while HEIGHT leans up the screen, which is what puts a
-- house's front and a cliff's face back on it.  `Gen4Camera` has the whole
-- argument, including how far that is from the cartridge's perspective one
-- (0.5% on the depth the screen covers; a tenth at its two edges).
--
-- THE CANVAS GROWS UPWARDS BY `leanPx`, because that is where the leaning
-- geometry goes: a chunk's ground still occupies rows leanPx..leanPx+512 and
-- anything standing on it reaches above that.  The blit takes the same leanPx
-- back off, so the ground lands where it always did.  Chunks are drawn north
-- to south, which is already the loop's order and is the order that has to
-- hold once one chunk's towers can overlap the next one's ground.
--
-- `MAX_RISE` is how much height the extra rows allow for.  Measured against
-- the build models this is generous -- the tallest houses are about 160 units
-- -- and terrain that climbs more than this inside one chunk loses its top few
-- rows rather than drawing over its neighbour.
local MAX_RISE = 384

-- HOW HIGH A CHARACTER REACHES, in the units the models are built in.
--
-- A tile is 16 units and an overworld sprite stands about two of them, so
-- geometry above 32 is over everybody's head.  That is the whole rule behind
-- the canopy: the part of a building higher than this can be painted AFTER the
-- sprites without ever covering one that is standing in front of it, and
-- painting it there is what lets somebody walk behind the house.
--
-- Approximate on purpose.  The exact answer depends on how far north of the
-- building the character is standing, which is a per-sprite comparison this
-- does not make; what it buys instead is occlusion at all, for one extra bake
-- and one extra blit, with no per-frame model draws.
local CANOPY_Y = 32

-- HOW TALL A THING HAS TO BE FOR THE HEIGHT CUT TO MEAN ANYTHING.
--
-- The cut paints the part of an object ABOVE head height over the sprites, so
-- it can only ever describe something taller than a character.  Measured over
-- all 590 building models, 338 of them -- 57.3% -- top out below `CANOPY_Y`,
-- and for every one of those the cut has nothing to say: `shelf01` ends at
-- exactly 32.00 and fails on the shader's `<=`, `table_l01` at 30,
-- `machine_pc01` at 24.16.
--
-- Reported from play: *"many indoor objects when walked behind dont mask the
-- player but houses do perfectly"*.  Houses are 71 to 91 and the cut serves
-- them well; furniture is 17 to 32 and the cut cannot serve it at all.
--
-- So a SHORT prop is sorted instead of cut: if the player is behind it, the
-- whole thing is painted over them; if they are in front, it is not painted at
-- all.  That is the y-sort Gen 1-3 has always used (`gen3AboveTopLayer`), and
-- it is right for exactly the objects the cut is wrong for.
--
-- The proper answer is neither -- it is the depth buffer, which the cartridge
-- uses and which pass 30's `beginWorld`/`drawSprite`/`endWorld` makes possible.
-- That needs the entity pass drawing into the world's target, which is a
-- change to the overworld's draw ORDER with a black-frame failure mode, in a
-- 730 KB function with two draw sites and one close point.  This is the part
-- that can be made correct without it.
local SORTED_BELOW = CANOPY_Y

-- ...AND IT IS THE CARTRIDGE'S CAMERA NOW, not an oblique approximation of it.
--
-- The oblique kept the ground plane one to one and leaned height up the screen
-- by cot(pitch).  That was chosen so no sprite had to move, and it is what made
-- the world read as flat: the cartridge COMPRESSES the ground.
--
-- `Camera_AdjustPositionAroundTarget` puts the eye due south of its target and
-- above it, which gives screen axes `right = (1,0,0)` and
-- `up = (0, cos p, -sin p)`, and therefore
--
--     screenX = x                screenY = z * sin(pitch) - y * cos(pitch)
--
-- Ground depth scales by sin, height by cos.  The oblique's 1 and cot are that
-- same picture stretched vertically by 1/sin -- 16.6% at DEFAULT's 59 degrees,
-- 30.4% at an interior's 50 -- and a world stretched a third taller than it
-- should be is a world that does not read as tilted at all.
--
-- ONLY TWO COEFFICIENTS CHANGE.  Row 2 is the screen-Y row: the height term
-- goes from `-2*lean/height` to `-2*cos/height` and the ground term from
-- `2/height` to `2*sin/height`.  At pitch 90 that is sin = 1, cos = 0, which
-- collapses to exactly the straight-down matrix above it -- so the OPTIONS
-- row's 90 is still the flat bake, with no second code path.
--
-- ROW 3, THE DEPTH ROW, IS LEFT ALONE and that is deliberate rather than
-- lazy: it reads `-(y + lean*z)/DEPTH_RANGE`, and multiplying through by
-- sin(pitch) gives `-(y*sin + z*cos)/(DEPTH_RANGE*sin)` -- the true view-axis
-- depth, scaled by a positive constant.  A depth test only cares about order,
-- so the row was already right for every pitch.

-- THE LIVE PASS
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- Reported from play, after the lighting and the tilt both landed: *"still
-- looks completely flat from my view ... current camera when walking makes it
-- look flat"*.
--
-- That is the correct diagnosis of something no amount of height fixes.  The
-- ground was drawn by BAKING each chunk once into a canvas and blitting the
-- canvas, and a blit is rigid: walking slides a finished 2D picture. Worse,
-- the matrix it was baked with is ORTHOGRAPHIC, and an orthographic projection
-- has NO MOTION PARALLAX BY CONSTRUCTION -- screen position is a linear
-- function of (x, y, z) with no divide by depth, so the offset between a
-- tree's top and its base cannot depend on where the camera is.
--
-- The cartridge's DEFAULT camera record says `projection = "perspective"`,
-- distance 666.92, half-fov 8.09.  That frustum gives 1.0125 px per unit at
-- the target, and geometry standing on the ground is nearer the eye:
--
--   a 42-unit tree      x1.0337  -> 4.3 px further out at the screen edge
--   t1_h01, 71 units    x1.0579  -> 7.4 px
--   t1_s01, 90.8 units  x1.0753  -> 9.6 px
--
-- Zero at the screen centre, largest at the edges -- so walking past a tree
-- sweeps its top about eight pixels across its own trunk.  THAT is the cue,
-- and it is worth more than any static amount of lean.
--
-- So the chunks are drawn EVERY FRAME into one screen-sized target instead of
-- once each into their own.  That is cheaper than it sounds and was probably
-- always the better shape: chunk 5 is 13 shapes and 1,464 vertices, chunk 0 is
-- 19 and 3,226, and a screen shows a handful -- tens of thousands of triangles
-- a frame, which is nothing, against a cache of 512x1010 canvases with a depth

-- WHAT DOES NOT MOVE IS THE GROUND, and that is the containment argument.  The

-- The depth row's divisor.  The live pass shares ONE buffer across every

-- HOW MANY REAL PIXELS THE 3D VIEW GETS
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- Reported from play: *"the first and third person are also really low
-- resolution and highly pixelated"*.
--
-- MEASURED, NOT GUESSED. `Renderer:fitScale` is
-- `floor(min(pw / uiW, ph / uiH))` and a Gen 4 UI is the DS's own 256x192, so
-- on a 1536-wide window the scale lands near 5 and `Renderer:worldViewSize`
-- hands this pass about 307x230. `drawFree` then allocated a target of exactly
-- that and the result was blitted up five times with NEAREST filtering.
--
-- That is RIGHT FOR PIXEL ART and wrong here. An integer scale with nearest is
-- what keeps a 16x16 tile crisp; perspective geometry has no pixel grid to
-- preserve, so the same treatment just makes it chunky. This is why the flat
-- and tilted views look fine and only the free camera reads as low resolution.
--
-- SUPERSAMPLING, not a bigger viewport. The target grows by `k` in each axis
-- and is blitted back at 1/k with linear filtering, so the DOWNSAMPLE is the
-- anti-aliasing. The projection is unaffected because a matrix depends on the
-- ASPECT, which k does not change, and 3D geometry lands in NDC and fills
-- whatever target is bound -- so the view shows exactly the same amount of
-- world. That containment is the whole point: growing `vw`/`vh` instead would
-- show MORE of Sinnoh than the game ever does, which is the 512x384 harness
-- trap this port has now walked into twice.
--
-- AND THE SPRITES COME ALONG FOR FREE, which is what makes this safe. The one
-- reader of `freeW`/`freeH` is `Gen4Ground:freeEntity`, which projects a
-- character through `view3d:project(..., vw, vh)` and applies the scale that
-- comes back. Setting them to the TARGET's size therefore moves every
-- character into target pixels with no graphics transform spanning the open

  -- to look right.  Two copies per turn is a sky moving at twice the world's
  -- rate, which the eye reads as the SKY turning rather than the camera.
  --
  -- There is nothing to tune.  A cloud infinitely far away sits at a fixed
  -- WORLD DIRECTION, so the panorama must span 360 degrees across its width
  -- exactly once, and one degree of yaw must move it by exactly the screen
  -- distance one degree of the world moves.

  -- WHERE THE HORIZON IS, in screen pixels -- LOCKED TO THE WORLD, exactly
  -- like the yaw.
  --
  -- THE SIGN HERE HAS BEEN WRONG TWICE, in opposite directions, and the second
  -- time was mine.
  --
  -- It began as `vh * 0.5 + pitch * pxPerDeg`.  Positive pitch in this engine
  -- is looking DOWN -- `forward()` returns `-sin(pitch)` for y -- and a camera
  -- looking down puts the horizon ABOVE the centre of the view, at
  -- `vh/2 - pitch * pxPerDeg`.  So the original moved the sky the WRONG WAY:
  -- it slid down as the world slid up, which reads as a sky travelling at
  -- double rate against the ground.  That is the original report.
  --
  -- Pass 46 then read *"the skybox shouldnt move when moving camera up or
  -- down"* as "pin it to the screen" and set this to `vh * 0.5` flat.  That
  -- removed the double rate by removing the response altogether, which is
  -- worse in a way that is easy to miss: a sky that holds still on the screen
  -- is a sky glued to the camera.  Reported straight back --
  --     *"the sky keep its look moving it with the camera rather than the
  --     clouds staying in the same place and me looking up beyond the cloud
  --     im looking at"*
  -- -- and that sentence is the specification.  A cloud is a fixed direction
  -- in the world; looking up must carry the view PAST it.
  --
  -- The correct term is the negative one, and it is not a taste: it is where a
  -- point at infinity on the eye plane actually projects.  Checked against the
  -- world rather than by eye -- `drawSky`'s horizon row is compared with the
  -- projection of a far-off point at the camera's own height, and the two have
  -- to land on the same pixel at every pitch.  Nothing here is tuned.
  --
  -- AND IT IS NOT LINEAR IN THE PITCH.  `vh/2 - pitch * pxPerDeg` is the
  -- small-angle form and it was measured against the world rather than
  -- trusted: it tracks to about two pixels at the resting pitch and then
  -- comes apart, 89 px out at 50 degrees and 845 px out at the top of the
  -- orbit.  A direction `a` off the view axis lands at
  -- `tan(a) / tan(fovY/2)` in normalised device units, not at `a` times a
  -- constant, so the horizon -- which sits `pitch` above the axis -- is:
  local tanHalf = math.tan(math.rad(fov / 2))

-- `CANOPY_Y` is a fixed world height of 32 and it is the WRONG MECHANISM, not
-- the wrong number.  Measured over all 590 building models, **338 of them --
-- 57.3% -- are entirely below it** and can therefore never mask anything, in
-- any room.  `shelf01` and `shelf05` top out at exactly 32.00 and fail on the
-- shader's `<=`; `table_l01` is 30, `machine_pc01` 24.16, `shelf_fs01` 21.
--
-- And RAISING the cut cannot fix it.  The cut paints the part of an object
-- ABOVE head height over the sprites, so for anything SHORTER than a character
-- there is nothing it can express: a shelf should hide a player's legs and
-- leave their head showing, which is not "above 32" of anything.
--
-- The cartridge has no cut.  It draws the world and the characters into one
-- depth-buffered 3D scene and occlusion falls out.  The live pass finally makes
-- that possible here, because the world is already rendered into a target with
-- a depth buffer -- so a character drawn into the SAME target at the SAME
-- depth the ground was drawn with is occluded correctly by everything, with no
-- height rule anywhere.
--
-- Three calls instead of one, because the entity pass runs between them:
--
--     ground:beginWorld(camX, camY, vw, vh)   -- target bound, ground drawn
--     ground:drawSprite(...)                  -- once per character
--     ground:endWorld()                       -- unbound and blitted
--
-- `draw` is untouched and still works for callers that have not been moved
-- over, so this can land before the overworld uses it.

-- A Gen 3 map is flat and its one elevation byte per tile is the whole story.
-- A Gen 4 map is a mesh: a bridge crosses over a path, a slope rises between
-- two tiles, a ledge has a top and a bottom at the same point. The BDHC in
-- each chunk is the cartridge's own answer -- sloped plates with a plane each
-- -- and all 666 of them parse, 8,974 plates between them.
--
-- MEASURED, over all 681,984 tile centres in the cartridge:
--
--   * 76.4% have a plate under them
--   * 0.48% have MORE THAN ONE, up to four deep -- which is the bridge case,
--     and the reason this returns a list rather than a number
--   * about 14% of WALKABLE tiles have none, and that is not a gap: a tile
--     with no plate is flat ground at the chunk's own base, which is what
--     DEFAULT is
--
-- AND IT USES THE BRUTE-FORCE LOOKUP, NOT THE STRIP INDEX. The BDHC carries a
-- scanline index for finding plates quickly, and checked against walking every
-- plate it agrees on 99.59% of tiles and DROPS a plate on 404 of 98,304 --
-- never the other way round. Thirteen plates per chunk is nothing to walk, and
