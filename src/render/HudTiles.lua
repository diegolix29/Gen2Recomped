-- 3 (the black rules).  There is no 170 anywhere, which is what the tint below
-- this used to divide by.
--
-- But the divisor was only half of it.  love.graphics.setColor MULTIPLIES, and
-- 85 * k cannot reach 189 unless k > 1 -- and LOVE clamps k at 1.  A screenshot
-- of Prism's battle HUD measures the fill exactly: the HP bar comes out
-- (0,85,0) where GREENBAR is (0,189,0), and the exp bar (33,85,85) where EXPBAR
-- is (33,140,255) -- red, the one channel whose multiplier was BELOW one
-- (33/85), is the one channel that came out right.  Every HP bar in the port
-- has been at a third of its colour, in battle, in the party menu and on the
-- summary screen; Prism is where it reads as broken rather than as dark,
-- because its bar carries a far heavier black frame (288 black pixels across
-- the fill tiles against Crystal's 72) and the thin band of colour between the
-- rules is all there is to see.
--
-- So the sheet is repainted instead of multiplied: the cartridge's four
-- palette entries replace the four DMG shades, which is what the hardware does
-- and is exact for every colour rather than only for the dark ones.  One image
-- per (sheet, palette name), built on first use and dropped with the pages.
