-- PLATINUM'S FIELD CAMERA, transcribed.
--
-- Reported from play: "The map is rendering in flat 2d ... continue with the
-- tiled perspective camera make sure you match the platinum rom code".  This
-- is the cartridge's own table, out of `overlay005/field_camera.c`, and the
-- arithmetic that turns it into something this engine can draw with.
--
-- SEVENTEEN CAMERAS, one per `CAMERA_TYPE_*`, and the map header picks which:
-- `MapHeader.cameraType` is the byte at offset 21 (`map_header.h`), which
-- `Gen4MapHeaders` has always parsed and nothing has ever read.  Counted over
-- all 593 headers in this cartridge:
--
--   DEFAULT               189      SPEAR_PILLAR             4
--   INTERIOR_ORTHOGRAPHIC 300      SLIGHTLY_ZOOMED_OUT      3
--   CAVE                   60      OREBURGH_GYM             2
--   ZOOMED_IN              19      HALL_OF_ORIGIN           2
--   IRON_ISLAND_CAVE        6      LAKE_ACUITY              2
--                                  six others, one each
--
-- So THREE HUNDRED of the 593 headers -- every ordinary room, the player's
-- bedroom included -- are ORTHOGRAPHIC on the cartridge.  "Flat" was never
-- the mistake; flat and STRAIGHT DOWN was.  Every one of the seventeen is
-- tilted, between 40.6 and 78.4 degrees.
--
-- ONE WORLD UNIT IS ONE SCREEN PIXEL, and that is the cartridge's own number
-- rather than this port's convenience.  `Camera_ComputeProjectionMatrix`
-- builds the orthographic box as `top = tan(fovY) * distance`, and for
-- INTERIOR_ORTHOGRAPHIC that is tan(3.5211181640625) * 1563.537841796875 =
-- 96.209 -- half of the DS's 192-row screen.  Run the same product over the
-- perspective types and they all land in 94.8..96.2.  `fovY` is therefore the
-- HALF vertical field of view, and the scale is 1:1 at the target plane.
--
-- The angle is `CameraAngle.x`, stored NEGATED in the table; `Camera_Adjust-
-- PositionAroundTarget` puts the camera at
--
--   position = target + ( sin(y)*d*cos(x), sin(-x)*d, cos(y)*d*cos(x) )
--
-- and `y` is zero for all seventeen, so the camera is always due SOUTH of its
-- target and above it: for DEFAULT, 571.97 up and 342.98 south.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- HOW THIS PORT DRAWS IT, and where it differs
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- The engine's world is a grid of 16-pixel tiles and EVERYTHING else in it --
-- collision, warps, sprites, the tile window, the encounter grid -- is laid
-- out in those pixels.  A true perspective camera moves the ground relative to
-- that grid, so adopting one means projecting every sprite through it as a
-- billboard in the same pass.  That is the right end state and it is not this
-- change.
--
-- What this does instead is an OBLIQUE projection at the cartridge's own
-- pitch:
--
--   screenX = x
--   screenY = z - y * cot(pitch)
--
-- The ground plane (y = 0) maps ONE TO ONE, so the tile grid, the collision
-- and every sprite stay exactly where they are and nothing above this file
-- changes.  HEIGHT leans up the screen, which is the whole point: a house
-- shows its front, a cliff shows its face, a bridge stands off the path under
-- it.  At pitch 90 the lean is zero and this is the straight-down bake that
-- came before, which is why the OPTIONS row can offer that as one of its
-- values without a second code path.
--
-- HOW FAR OFF THE CARTRIDGE IS, measured rather than waved at.  The cartridge
-- scales ground depth by sin(pitch) and height by cos(pitch); this scales them
-- by 1 and cos/sin.  That is the cartridge's own picture stretched vertically
-- by 1/sin(pitch) -- 16.7% for DEFAULT -- and the stretch is the price of
-- keeping a tile 16 pixels tall.  The remaining difference is the perspective
-- itself, and on this cartridge that is SMALL: a half-FOV of 8.09 degrees at
-- 666.9 units is a very long lens.  Ray-traced against the ground plane, the
-- DEFAULT camera sees from 101.87 units in front of the target to 120.86
-- behind it -- 222.73 units of ground over 192 rows, against 223.87 for an
-- orthographic camera at the same scale.  That is 0.51% on the total, and
-- +9.9% / -7.4% on the two halves.  It is the near and far EDGES of the screen
-- that are wrong, by about a tenth, and the centre that is right.
--
-- For the 300 INTERIOR_ORTHOGRAPHIC headers there is no difference at all
-- beyond the 1/sin stretch: the cartridge is orthographic there too.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE CARTRIDGE'S OWN PROJECTION, derived rather than approximated
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- Everything above describes the OBLIQUE stand-in this port draws with.  What
-- follows is the real thing, read out of `camera.c` and `field_camera.c`, so
-- that the renderer has something exact to move to and so the size of the gap
-- is a number rather than an impression.
--
-- `Camera_AdjustPositionAroundTarget` puts the eye at
--
--     eye = target + ( sin(yaw)*d*cos(ax), sin(-ax)*d, cos(yaw)*d*cos(ax) )
--
-- with `ax = -pitch` and `yaw = 0` for all seventeen types, so
--
--     eye = target + ( 0, d*sin(pitch), d*cos(pitch) )
--
-- -- above the target and due SOUTH of it.  `up` is +Y.  The screen axes that
-- fall out of that are
--
--     right = ( 1, 0, 0 )
--     up    = ( 0, cos(pitch), -sin(pitch) )
--
-- and so, for a point offset from the target by (dx, dy, dz):
--
--     screenX =  dx
--     screenY = -dz * sin(pitch) - dy * cos(pitch)      (screen Y grows down)
--
-- GROUND DEPTH SCALES BY sin(pitch) AND HEIGHT BY cos(pitch).  At pitch 90 --
-- straight down -- that is ground 1:1 and no height at all, which is the flat
-- bake; at DEFAULT's 59.05 degrees it is 0.8576 and 0.5143.
--
-- THE SCALE IS ONE WORLD UNIT TO ONE SCREEN PIXEL, and that is the
-- cartridge's number, not this port's convenience: `tan(halfFov) * distance`
-- is 94.82 for DEFAULT, 96.21 for INTERIOR, 96.13 for CAVE, 95.15 for
-- ZOOMED_IN -- all of them half of the DS's 192-row screen, to within 1.3%.
--
-- WHAT THE OBLIQUE COSTS, exactly.  It scales ground by 1 and height by
-- cot(pitch); the cartridge scales them by sin and cos.  Since
-- cot = cos/sin, the oblique is the cartridge's picture STRETCHED VERTICALLY
-- BY 1/sin(pitch) -- 16.6% at DEFAULT, 30.4% at INTERIOR's 50.09 degrees.
-- Shapes are right; the world is too tall.
--
-- AND WHAT PERSPECTIVE WOULD ADD ON TOP, measured on the ground plane rather
-- than guessed: at the top and bottom edges of the screen the scale differs
-- from the orthographic one by 14.2% (DEFAULT), 16.7% (CAVE) and 18.5%
-- (ZOOMED_IN), and by 6.2% for INTERIOR -- which is moot, because INTERIOR is
-- orthographic on the cartridge and so are 300 of the 593 headers.  An earlier
-- note in this file put that figure at "about a tenth"; it was measured on the
-- depth the screen covers rather than on the scale at its edges, and the
-- number above is the one that describes what a player sees.

-- HOW FAR THE HEIGHT SCALE MAY BE PUSHED.
--
-- `Gen4Ground` sizes a chunk's canvas as `chunkPx * ground + height * MAX_RISE`
-- with MAX_RISE 384, so the height scale is what decides how tall a bake is:
-- 1.5 puts a 512-wide chunk on a 1,015-row canvas, and sixteen of those with
-- their depth buffers is about the most this cache should hold.  A rung
-- steeper than the ladder below would exceed it, so the clamp is here rather
-- than in the ladder -- a number that cannot be reached is not a limit.
local MAX_HEIGHT_SCALE = 1.5

-- cot(pitch), guarded at both ends: zero at 90 (straight down, no lean at all)
-- and floored at 5 degrees so a bad value cannot divide by nothing.
local function cot(pitch)
  pitch = tonumber(pitch) or 90
  if pitch >= 89.999 then return 0 end
  if pitch < 5 then pitch = 5 end
  return cos(rad(pitch)) / sin(rad(pitch))
end

-- THE GROUND SCALE AND THE HEIGHT SCALE, AND WHY THEY ARE NO LONGER ONE ANGLE.
--
-- On the cartridge they are: one pitch gives `sin` for ground depth and `cos`
-- for height, and a player who wanted more lean could only get it by tilting
-- the camera -- which SQUASHES THE MAP at the same time.  At 40 degrees a tree
-- rises twice as far and the whole of Sinnoh loses a quarter of its depth, so
-- the control traded one kind of wrong for another and the picture did not
-- obviously improve.
--
-- Reported from play: *"make the tilt work with the 3d of the world so the 3d
-- becomes more visible when used"*.  That is a request for a HEIGHT control,
-- not a camera angle, so the two are separated here:
--
--     ground = sin(mapPitch)                    -- never moves
--     height = sin(mapPitch) * cot(heightPitch) -- the OPTIONS row
--
-- `heightPitch` defaults to the map's own pitch, and there the identity
-- `sin * cos/sin = cos` gives back EXACTLY the cartridge's pair -- so
-- "CARTRIDGE" is bit-for-bit what it always was and every other rung raises
-- the height alone, leaving the map's footprint where it is.
--
-- `Gen4Ground.projection` already takes the two as an independent pair and
-- derives its lean and its depth row from them, so nothing downstream needed
-- to learn about this.
function Gen4Camera.scales(config)
  local pitch = rad((config and config.pitch) or 90)
  local ground = sin(pitch)
  local height = ground * cot((config and config.heightPitch) or (config and config.pitch) or 90)
  if height > MAX_HEIGHT_SCALE then height = MAX_HEIGHT_SCALE end
  return ground, height
end

-- Project a point given as an offset from the camera's TARGET, in world units,
-- to an offset in screen pixels.  `y` is height; `z` is south.  Screen Y grows

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The OPTIONS row
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- "CARTRIDGE" is the map header's own camera type, which is the answer this
-- file exists to give; the fixed angles are there because a player who wants
-- the old flat view, or more lean than Sinnoh ever uses, should not have to
-- edit a file for it.  90 is exactly the straight-down bake.
-- 30 is the steepest rung, and it is the clamp above that decides that rather
-- than taste: at the DEFAULT camera's ground scale it puts the height scale at
-- 1.485, a hair under MAX_HEIGHT_SCALE, and a 42-unit tree at 63 screen pixels
-- against the cartridge's 22.
-- ...AND THE TWO FREE MODES ON THE END OF THE SAME LADDER.

-- Requested: *"have first and third person as an option within the tilt"*.
-- They belong here rather than on a control of their own because they answer
-- the same question every other rung does -- how much of the world's height do
-- I want to see -- and a player who has walked the ladder from CARTRIDGE down
-- to 30 is already asking for more of it.
--
-- A string rung carries no pitch, so `forMap` leaves the map header's own in

  -- and squashed the map to buy the lean.  The chosen angle now names the
  -- HEIGHT alone; everything that asks this config how deep the ground is --
  -- the blit, the sprite placement, `unprojectGround` turning a screen row
  -- back into a tile row -- still gets the map's own answer and needs no
  -- second thought about which pitch it is holding.

  -- AND HOW MUCH PARALLAX, which is the other half of *"make the tilt show 3d
  -- like the first and 3rd person do"*.
  --
  -- Measured before touching it: the spread is `cos(pitch)/distance` off the
  -- map header, so it read 0.0007711 per unit on EVERY rung of the ladder --
  -- 19.7% of the frame failing to cancel at rung 90 and 13.5% at rung 30, i.e.
  -- stepping the ladder never added any depth at all.  And for the 300
  -- INTERIOR_ORTHOGRAPHIC headers -- every ordinary room -- it was exactly
  -- 0.00% at every rung, 0 pixels of 184,320, because an orthographic
  -- projection has no parallax by construction.  The tilt could not show depth
  -- indoors however far it was stepped.
  --
  -- The spread is a fact about WHERE THE CAMERA SITS, so the honest way to make
  -- it larger is to bring the camera closer -- not to scale the term by a
  -- number chosen to look right.  The rung interpolates the eye's distance
  -- between the map header's own and `NEAREST_DISTANCE`, and the ROM supplies
  -- both ends.  (Reciprocally -- see below for why that is not a detail.)
  --
  -- THE GROUND PLANE IS UNTOUCHED, which is the whole containment argument:
  -- the shader's factor is `1 - y * spread`, exactly 1 at y = 0, so every
  -- sprite, pick and tile-row answer the overworld computes from `scales()` and
  -- `unprojectGround` reads the same as before.  `pitch`, `distance` and
  -- `projection` are all left alone for the same reason.

    -- INTERPOLATE THE RECIPROCAL, because the spread IS proportional to 1 over
    -- the distance.  Two things follow, and both are the reason it is written
    -- this way round:
    --
    -- * An ORTHOGRAPHIC header starts at 1/D = 0, which is what orthographic
    --   MEANS -- a camera at infinity.  So rung 90 leaves those 300 rooms
    --   exactly as flat as the cartridge draws them, and the depth comes up
    --   from nothing as the player steps down the ladder.  Interpolating the
    --   distance itself instead handed rung 90 a spread of 0.0004104 and 12.13%
    --   parallax on the FLATTEST rung, which reads as a distortion rather than
    --   as depth: at rung 90 the height scale is 0, so nothing is raised and
    --   the splay has nothing to belong to.
    -- * Parallax then grows LINEARLY with the rung, which is the property a
    --   ladder should have.
