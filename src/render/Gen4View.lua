-- Gen4View: a real camera, for the first- and third-person modes.
--
-- WHY THIS IS A NEW FILE AND NOT A FLAG ON THE OLD MATRIX.
--
-- `Gen4Ground:screenMatrix` is an OBLIQUE projection: it maps ground depth by
-- `sin(pitch)` and height by `cos(pitch)` and has no notion of yaw at all --
-- the camera is always due south of its target, exactly as the cartridge's own
-- seventeen rows are.  Two things follow.  It cannot look in an arbitrary
-- direction, which is the whole of first person; and its two axes are scaled
-- by DIFFERENT amounts, which is a deliberate squash for the field view and
-- would be a defect anywhere else.
--
-- Reported as the requirement: *"implement first person and third person to
-- work with the 3d models if possible without stretching the textures or
-- models of the house"*.  A true perspective camera is the thing that
-- guarantees that rather than merely avoiding it: `Gen4Model.perspective`
-- divides x by the ASPECT RATIO and leaves y alone, so a square in the world
-- is a square on the screen at every window size, and a texture on a wall
-- keeps its proportions however the wall is turned.  The field view's squash
-- is the exception in this engine, not the rule.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE SPACE
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- The same one every other Gen 4 surface uses, and it is worth stating because
-- two of the three axes are not what a fresh reader assumes:
--
--   +x  EAST        +y  UP        +z  SOUTH
--
-- Distances are world units, one per map pixel, sixteen to a tile. Positions
-- are ABSOLUTE MATRIX coordinates -- the same ones `Gen4Ground:draw` builds as
-- `camX + offsetX` -- so a camera does not need to know which map it is on,
-- which matters precisely because a Sinnoh view spans several.
--
-- `yaw` is 0 looking NORTH and grows clockwise (east at a quarter turn), which
-- is the order the cartridge's own four facings are numbered in.
-- `pitch` is 0 at the horizon and POSITIVE LOOKING DOWN, matching
-- `Gen4Camera`'s rows, where the field camera's 59.05 is a steep downward look.

Gen4View.MODES = { "field", "third", "first" }

-- WHERE THE EYE SITS IN FIRST PERSON.
--
-- Reported from play: *"first person also has the camera too low should be
-- head height on the player"*.  It was 22, on a comment claiming the player
-- model "stands about 24 tall" -- a number nothing in this port had measured,
-- and one that disagrees with `ORBIT_PIVOT_Y`'s own comment three screens
-- down, which calls 16 the player's CHEST.  Both cannot be right: a chest at
-- 16 puts the crown near 32, not 24.
--
-- MEASURED INSTEAD, off the cartridge's own human-scale object -- a doorway,
-- which is built to clear a head and is the one prop whose height states what
-- a person is.  Decoded from `build_model.narc`:
--
--     door_pc01   30.50 units tall, standing from y = 0
--     door_wi01   30.50
--     door01      27.21
--     t1_h01 (a Twinleaf house)   71.00
--
-- So a doorway is 30.5 and the eye goes just under it: 26 is 0.85 of the
-- door, which leaves head clearance rather than putting the eye level with
-- the lintel.  It also squares with the pivot -- 16 against 26 is chest
-- against eye.  This is OUR number, not the cartridge's: Platinum has a fixed
-- camera and no first person, so nothing in the ROM states an eye height.
-- What the ROM states is the scale, and that is what 26 is taken from.
Gen4View.EYE_HEIGHT = 26

-- ...AND WHERE IT SITS IN THIRD PERSON.
--
-- Far enough back that the player occupies about a sixth of the frame height,
-- which is roughly what the field view gives them, and raised by a third of
-- that so the camera looks slightly down -- the angle a player reads as
-- "behind and above" rather than "lying on the floor behind".

Gen4View.FOLLOW_PITCH = 18

-- The vertical field of view.
--
-- NOT the cartridge's 16.2 degrees: that is a long lens chosen to make the
-- field view 1:1 with the DS screen at the target plane, and through it a
-- first-person view would feel like looking down a tube.  50 is the ordinary
-- choice for a first-person camera and it is a MODE setting rather than a
-- cartridge fact, so it is named here instead of being derived from something
-- that does not govern it.
Gen4View.FOV_Y = 50

-- Near plane close enough to stand against a wall without it vanishing; far
-- plane past the visible chunk span (three 512-unit chunks plus slack).
Gen4View.NEAR = 4
Gen4View.FAR = 4096

-- WHERE THE PLAYER LEFT THE CAMERA, kept in the MODULE and not on the view.
--
-- Reported from play: *"when changing from a town or route or map chunk its
-- resetting my camera"*.  A `Gen4Ground` is built per map, and `applyCamera`
-- builds it a fresh `Gen4View` -- so the orbit and the zoom lived on an object
-- that died at every doorway and every route boundary.  Walking north and back
-- put the camera behind the player again.
--
-- Held here for the same reason `Gen4Camera` holds the tilt choice in its
-- module: the thing that needs it is rebuilt by the map loader, which is never
-- handed a game and has no business carrying a camera across for it.  A look
-- the player set is a PREFERENCE, and it should outlive the map the way the
-- tilt rung and the zoom level already do.
--
-- `heading` is separate from `yaw` and both are needed.  `yaw` is the ORBIT's
-- angle and exists only while the player is orbiting; `heading` is the
-- direction the camera actually ended up looking on the last frame, whether
-- that came from an orbit, from the player's facing, or from its own previous
-- value.  Keeping only the first is what made a map change spin the view:
-- reported from play, *"camera flipping on route/chunk/city change, when i
-- walk into a new area its rotating my camera 180 degrees"* -- a player who
-- had never touched the orbit controls had `yaw = nil` kept, so the rebuilt
-- camera started at 0 (north) and anyone walking SOUTH was turned exactly
-- about.  Measured before the fix: 180.00 degrees across the boundary when
-- the player had never orbited, 0.00 when they had.

-- and a mouse orbit as well as the 3D view they asked for.

  -- hands the row to whichever view is up -- so stepping onto a tilt rung and
  -- back into third person left the third-person camera on the cartridge's
  -- 16.2-degree field instead of its own 50.  Caught by a masking check whose
  -- CONTROL painted nothing: the marker was outside a frustum a third as wide,
  -- and a control that paints nothing is the signal that something upstream
  -- moved, not a result.
  --
  -- Nothing needs the stored value anyway: `effectiveFovY` derives the field
  -- camera's fov from the row's DISTANCE and the target height, so that a unit
  -- stays a pixel, and every other mode keeps `Gen4View.FOV_Y`.
end

-- follow(x, z, facing) -- put the camera where the mode says, given where the

-- the base elevation is 14.04 degrees, so a rise of -14.04 puts it exactly ON
-- the pivot plane and anything below drives it underground.  -12 leaves about
-- two degrees of clearance at every zoom -- 3.5 units at the near stop, 9 at the
-- far one -- which is the shallowest look the sphere can offer without digging.
--
-- This stops the camera burying itself in FLAT ground.  Terrain that rises

  -- it is BUILT: a neighbour loaded before the player touched the mouse keeps

-- every one of those systems silently answering about the wrong tile.  So the
-- step stays on the grid and only which of the four it means is rotated.
--

-- "away from the eye" would always be "forward" -- tank controls, and a change
-- to how the game plays for someone who only wanted a camera angle.

-- THE FIELD OF VIEW THIS CAMERA ACTUALLY DRAWS WITH, for a vh-tall target.
--
-- The cartridge's `halfFov` is written for the DS's 192-row screen, where it
-- makes one world unit exactly one screen pixel at the target plane
-- (`tan(fovY) * distance` is 94.8..96.2 across the seventeen rows).  This
-- engine renders into a viewport that is not 192 rows, and a unit is a pixel
-- everywhere else in it -- the tiles, the sprites, the collision picks and the
-- oblique pass all count that way.
--
-- Taking the cartridge's ANGLE on a 384-row target magnifies everything 2x and
-- shows half as much world, which would make stepping onto a tilt rung read as
-- a zoom.  So what is kept from the row is the thing that is a fact about the
-- camera -- WHERE IT SITS, its distance and its pitch -- and the fov is the
-- one that preserves the engine's scale.  At `distance` this gives exactly one
-- pixel per unit, which is the cartridge's own relationship, just stated for
-- the screen we have.
--
-- The orthographic branch in `matrix` does the same thing by construction with
-- `halfHeight = vh / 2`, so the two projections agree about scale.
