-- THE UNDERGROUND: getting down there and back up.
--
-- The Explorer Kit had no effect at all, and the Underground had nothing
-- pointing at it -- not because the map was missing but because nothing named
-- it.  `maps["UG"]` is header 2, 480x480, label "Mystery Zone", music 1060
-- (SEQ_TANKOU), 21 objects, and it has been in the dataset all along.  It was
-- invisible to a search because the writer PACKS a large map entry into its own
-- chunk: the file says `__t["id"] = "UG"`, never `id = "UG"`, so grepping the
-- dataset the way every other map answers to found nothing and the map looked
-- absent.  Worth remembering -- the entries big enough to be packed are exactly
-- the interesting ones.
--
-- WHAT IS AND IS NOT HERE.  This is the descend and the ascend.  Mining,
-- spheres, traps, secret bases, the vendors and the top-screen radar are not
-- written yet; in the cartridge they are ~23,500 lines under `src/underground/`
-- and a third of that is DS-to-DS wireless that has no meaning in this port.
