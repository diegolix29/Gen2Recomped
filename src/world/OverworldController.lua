-- widened to everything the current view size can show so a full
-- zoom-out never runs past the rendered set.  Re-run whenever the view
-- grows (zoom/resize), not only on setMap.
--
-- Neighbors are built eagerly here.  A TileRenderer is now a light object --
-- the tile layer draws windowed to the camera, so nothing per-map is
-- constructed up front (see TileRenderer) -- so there is no build cost to
-- amortize and no prefetch race to lose at a seam.  That is what the old
-- one-per-frame streaming queue existed to hide, and it is gone.
-- How far out from the player the neighbour set has to reach, in world
-- pixels, as a HALF-EXTENT either side.
--
-- The flat view answers this for itself: half the visible world plus a tile
-- row of slack is exactly what a 160x144 screen can show past its own edge.
-- A 3D renderer cannot use that answer. A diorama camera pulled back over a
-- route sees several screens in every direction, and what is not in
-- `self.neighbors` is not merely undrawn -- it was never loaded, so the
-- renderer has no map there to mesh and falls back to its own border-block
-- apron. That is the wall of border tiles fencing in a route, and the
-- neighbour that only appears once you have crossed the seam: the set is
-- rebuilt around the new map on arrival, which is the first moment it
-- contains anything you were already looking at.
--
-- So a renderer that sees further says so, by setting `neighborReachW` /
-- `neighborReachH` on the world -- the same shape as `viewW`/`viewH`, and
-- for the same reason: the engine cannot infer another renderer's frustum,
-- and guessing a generous default would load half of Johto for the flat game
-- that never asked. Unset is today's behaviour exactly.

-- ghost cast -- which is why it is a request from the thing doing the drawing

-- next `disappear` of an unrelated grunt re-ran this filter, saw Lance's flag
-- set, and deleted him.  The matching `clearevent` a few rows later does not
-- re-spawn anything (setevent/clearevent never do, by design), so Lance was
-- simply absent for the whole post-battle scene: every turnobject and
-- applymovement aimed at him did nothing, and he turned up on the next map
-- load wherever the respawn tables happened to put him.  The full sweep is
-- still correct for what it models -- LoadMapObjects, driven by
-- refreshmap/reloadmap -- so it stays available with `only` unset.

-- them in step by hand, plus whatever a mod does with `world.entities`, which
-- both of the voxel mods hold directly.
--
-- Lose an NPC from `entities` alone and it does not error, it does not warn,

-- THE TILESET ATLAS A MAP DRAWS FROM, for a mod that renders the world itself.

-- samples the tileset SHEET per face, with its own UVs. So a mod that replaces
-- the world pass needs the same sheet the flat renderer builds its quads from,
-- and the tileset record that says how it is laid out.
--
-- The name is the one Gen1Recomp published and mods were written against
-- (`World:atlasFor`). Without it STADIUM2_OVERWORLD_MODELS fails at
-- `attachRenderer` with "Gold World:atlasFor is unavailable", its renderFrame
-- returns no canvas, and the engine quietly falls back to the flat draw --
-- which reads, from the player's side, as "the 3D world just does not turn on"
-- with an empty log and every option switched on. Providing it is cheap and it
-- is the seam the contract already assumed.
--
-- Returns the RAW sheet, deliberately, plus the tileset record:
--   * a caller doing its own colour work (Gen 2 art is four-shade source, and
--     the palette is chosen per 8x8 tile at bake time) needs the unbaked
--     pixels, and re-baking an already-baked atlas would double-apply it;
--   * `map.renderer.image` -- the baked one -- stays available to anything
--     that wants what the 2D path actually painted.
--
-- `mapDef` is a map DEFINITION (`Game.data.maps.CERULEAN_CITY`), matched
-- against the current map and its loaded neighbours first so the live tileset
-- record (with any runtime normalisation on it) wins; a def for a map that is
-- not resident falls back to the static tileset table.
-- Returns nil when the sheet cannot be resolved -- never raises, because this
