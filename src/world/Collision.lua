-- spot anybody.  The other three all stop the line, which is the sentence
-- above -- a wall, a ledge to another level, or ANOTHER NPC.

--   a full rail is ridden ALONG ITS AXIS, either way, and is a wall across it
--   an isolated rail is not entered by moving into it at all
--
-- `mover.acroBike` is what the Acro Bike sets and `mover.acroTrick` is the
-- trick in progress -- "wheelie" from the moment B goes down, "hop" only once
-- the wheelie has been held past its own threshold (see
-- OverworldState:updateAcroBike).
local ACRO_AXIS_DIRS = {
  vertical   = { up = true, down = true },

-- WHO MAY MOVE ONTO ONE, WHICH IS NOT WHAT THIS USED TO SAY.
--
-- Reported from play: "for these tiles that are bike paths above water areas
-- like in route 119 you should be able to ride on them on the bike, and if
-- using the acro bike while bunny hopping and holding a direction bunny hop
-- between them to get through the paths".  You could not ride them at all:
-- this asked for the Acro Bike AND a trick AND a direction along the rail,
-- and the cartridge asks for none of the three.
--
-- THE CARTRIDGE'S OWN CHAIN, read end to end.  CheckAcroBikeCollision
-- (008B2E4) runs inside the shared CheckForObjectEventCollision wherever the
-- ordinary collision came back NONE, and turns the five behaviours into a
-- code out of its own two tables (0849749C and 084974B0):
--
--     bumpy slope                9
--     isolated vertical rail    10
--     isolated horizontal rail  11
--     vertical rail             12
--     horizontal rail           13
--
-- Any non-zero code stops ordinary movement, which is why all five are walls
-- on foot.  What differs is what each BIKE TRANSITION does with the code:
--
--   AcroBikeTransition_Moving        (011987A)  0 or >11 -> move
--   MachBikeTransition_TrySpeedUp    (01192D8)  0 or >11 -> move
--   AcroBike WheelieMoving           (0119AEE)  0 or >11 -> move; 9 -> stay
--   AcroBike WheelieHoppingMoving    (01199EE)  0, 9, or >11 -> move
--
-- So a FULL RAIL (12 or 13) is ridden by EITHER BIKE with no trick at all and
-- in any direction -- the rail is a road, not an obstacle -- and the BUMPY
-- SLOPE (9) wants the BUNNY HOP specifically: a wheelie on one stands still
-- (PlayerIdleWheelie), which is the half this port had as "either trick".
--
-- The ISOLATED rails (10, 11) are entered by NOTHING that moves.  They are
-- crossed by the Acro Bike's SIDE JUMP -- a perpendicular direction tapped
-- and released inside six frames (AcroBikeHandleInputTurning, 01194D4),
-- which leaps two tiles (0119A24) -- and a jump is not a step, so it never
-- comes through here.  Refusing them is right until that lands.
--
-- What keeps a rider ON a rail is a different rule about a different tile:
-- see Collision.railHolds below.

-- makes a rail a path -- you get on, and then it carries you -- and it is the
-- half whose absence made "enter only along the axis" look almost right while
-- keeping the rider off the rail altogether.

-- THE SIDE JUMP, which is how you actually get from one rail to the next.
--
-- Reported from play: "The bunny hopping doesnt work to move between the
-- rails, and its letting me turn the bike vertically when i dont think it
-- should while on these rails double check the rom on how this should
-- function."  The rom says the bunny hop never crosses anything: the
-- BUNNY_HOP state handler (01195E0) answers only FACE_DIRECTION, HOPPING
-- STANDING, HOPPING MOVING or MOVING, and HOPPING MOVING asks
-- CanBikeFaceDirOnMetatile first, so a rider hopping on a rail is held on it
-- exactly like a rider who is not.
--
-- What crosses is sAcroBikeTransitions[8], AcroBikeTransition_SideJump
-- (0119A24), reached ONLY from the TURNING state (01194C8) -- which state 0
-- enters when a direction that is not the rider's facing arrives while the
-- rider is not already moving.  TURNING lasts six frames; inside them,
-- AcroBike_GetJumpDirection (0119D30) walks a four-row table at 0x085974C0:
--
--     dirHistory  & 0xF == the direction        (SOUTH/NORTH/WEST/EAST)
--     abHistory   & 0xF == 2                    (B, and only B, of ABSS)
--     both of those histories no older than four frames (0x085974BE = {4,0})
--
-- The histories only rotate when their value CHANGES (0119C64), so "no older
-- than four frames" means each was PRESSED four frames ago or less -- B held
-- down since before the tap does not qualify, which is the other half of why
-- hopping across cannot work.  The press that does it is the direction and B
-- together.  Matching direction that is the OPPOSITE of facing is a turn
-- jump instead (transition 9); anything else perpendicular is this.
--
-- IT IS ONE TILE, AND IT DOES NOT TURN YOU.  Reported from play: "When
-- hopping between them its making me jump 2 at once instead of one at a
-- time, and its changing me to face the direction im moving in when it
-- shouldnt".  Both are the cartridge's, and both were read off the wrong
-- routine here first:
--
--   * SideJump ends in 0093514, whose ids are 0x42..0x45, whose init is
--     InitJump(..., distance = 1, ...).  THE LEDGE is the two-tile one --
--     PlayerJumpLedge (008B840) ends in 0093490, ids 0x0C..0x0F, distance 2
--     -- and the two were conflated.  InitJump's own table settles it
--     (0x0850DFBC = {0,1,1} placed, 0x0850DFC2 = {0,0,1} added on landing:
--     distance 1 is one tile, distance 2 is two).
--
--   * SideJump sets facingDirectionLocked before it asks for the movement
--     (`ldrb r0,[r4,#1] / orr r0,#2 / strb r0,[r4,#1]` at 0119A6C, bit 9 of
--     the ObjectEvent bitfield).  The rider leaps sideways STILL FACING the
--     way they were going.
--
-- ...and the two together are what make a crossing possible at all.  The
-- jump is chosen only when the press is PERPENDICULAR to facing, so a facing
-- that followed the leap would make the second hop of a chain no longer
-- perpendicular and the chain would stop after one stone.  MAP_G00_N34 is
-- built entirely out of that chain: a vertical rail at x4 carries the rider
-- south to row 10, three ISOLATED vertical rails sit at x5..x7, and another
-- full vertical rail at x8 carries them on south -- so the crossing is three
-- eastward hops taken one stone at a time, all of them still facing south.
--
-- What the jump may clear, from SideJump's own head -- and with one tile of
-- travel, the tile it clears IS the tile it lands on:
--
--     collision 0        -> jump          (an ordinary empty tile)
--     collision 7        -> nothing at all
--     collision 1..9     -> TurnDirection (a wall, or the bumpy slope)
--     collision 10..13   -> jump IFF 0119FC4 says so
--
-- and 0119FC4 is one rule stated twice: a north/south leap is refused onto a
-- VERTICAL rail (10, 12) and an east/west leap onto a HORIZONTAL one (11,
-- 13).  A rail running the way you are jumping is a road you should be
-- riding; a rail running across your leap is the stepping stone.

-- and rails, the tile pairs, the occupancy.  What there was no way to do from
-- outside this file was ask that question about a cell you name yourself.
--
-- A caller that moves CONTINUOUSLY has to.  A grid step is always one cell in
-- one of four directions, so a direction IS a target; a body with a radius
-- sliding along a wall overlaps up to two cells per axis, and has to ask about
-- each of them.  Without this, such a caller has no choice but to restate the
-- test -- and a restatement is a copy that stops being true the day a clause
-- is added here.  That is exactly what had happened: the voxel mod's free walk
-- reimplemented four of these seven tests and silently lost the other three,
-- so in first and third person Hoenn had no elevation at all -- 4,376 cliff
-- steps and 3,704 water steps across 107 maps that the grid walk refuses.
--
-- `dir` is the AXIS BEING CROSSED, not the bearing to the cell: a body sliding
-- east asks "right" about every cell on its leading edge, including the one
-- diagonally ahead, because east is the way it is going through that
-- boundary.  That is the reading sideWallBlocked and railHolds want -- both
-- are about which SIDE is fenced -- and it is the only one a diagonal probe
-- has, since the mover crosses one axis at a time.  A caller with no axis to
-- name may pass nil: the two direction-keyed tests then look up a nil key,
-- find nothing, and the other five answer in full.
