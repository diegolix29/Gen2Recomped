-- A MAP THAT POINTS AT A SHARED GRID INSTEAD OF CARRYING ONE.
--
-- Gen 4 splits its collision the way Gen 3 splits its layouts: a grid is built
-- once per MATRIX and a map that does not own its matrix outright references
-- it, because the 30x30 Sinnoh overworld is 921,600 cells and inlining it once
-- per building standing on it took the extraction from 4 seconds to 22.
--
-- NOTHING EVER READ THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT SPLIT.  `map_layouts` is written by
-- the Gen 4 extractor and, at run time, is only ever touched by one Gen 3
-- script command.  `Map` reads `def.blocks` and nothing else -- so **291 of
-- the 593 Gen 4 maps had no collision data at all**, which is what "collisions
-- dont seem to be correct in the overworld" is: not a wrong grid, an absent
-- one.
--
-- Resolved here rather than in `Map` because this is the one place that has
-- both the def and the dataset, and written BACK ONTO THE DEF rather than onto
-- a copy: half the engine compares `map.def` against `data.maps[id]` by
-- identity, and a copy would quietly become a second map. Idempotent, so a
-- reload costs nothing.
