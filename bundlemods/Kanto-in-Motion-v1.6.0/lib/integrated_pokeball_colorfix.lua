-- Pokeball Colorfix
--
-- Makes the thrown Poke Ball render in its own colors. Two things are wrong
-- in the stock engine, and they have to be fixed together.
--
-- 1. The WIDE battle layout never colorizes the OAM animation layer at all.
--    BattleState:draw hands off to WideBattle.draw, whose drawAnimationLayer
--    calls battle:drawAnimLayer(FALSE) -- no color function, so
--    AnimPlayer:drawSprites skips the shade-remap shader and blits raw DMG
--    grays. The OG layout passes true on the same call. WideBattle.zones()
--    also returns colors = false over the whole surface, so nothing
--    downstream colors it either. That is why the ball is the ONE gray thing
--    in an otherwise colored wide battle.
--
-- 2. The ball has no palette of its own. BattleState:animSpriteColors resolves
--    every anim sprite against zoneColorsAt() -- the SGB zone palette under
--    that screen cell. Mid-arc the ball is over the enemy mon's zone, so it
--    wears the ENEMY SPECIES' colors. On hardware this never showed, because
--    the ball's OAM slot ($f0) maps to shades 0 and 3 -- the near-white and
--    near-black anchors -- so it read as a white ball with a black outline
--    whatever palette was underneath. Colorizing it without fixing this just
--    exposes the borrowed hue: the ball comes out the color of the Pokemon
--    you are throwing it at (blue at a Tentacool, and so on).
--
--    So the ball gets a FIXED palette here instead of a sampled one.
--
-- ------- why a two-tone ball is possible at all
--
-- The tile is 2bpp: color 0 transparent, plus colors 1/2/3. The shade maps
-- in BattleState tell you what each one is:
--
--     f0  = { 0, 3, 3 }   color 1 -> lightest, colors 2 and 3 -> darkest
--     f0x = { 3, 0, 3 }   color 1 -> darkest,  color 2 -> lightest
--
-- f0x is DoBallTossSpecialEffects' Master/Ultra flicker, which XORs rOBP0
-- with %00111100 -- "complementing colors 1 and 2". Color 2 flipping to the
-- LIGHT shade under f0x is the proof that color 2 is its own visible region
-- of the sprite, distinct from the color-3 outline. On the Game Boy that
-- region just renders dark, which is what gives the classic dark-topped
-- ball. It is the top half. So:
--
--     color 1 -> body      (white)
--     color 2 -> top half  (the ball's identity color)
--     color 3 -> outline and band (near-black)
--
-- Change BALLS below to taste -- values are plain 0-255 RGB.
--
-- ------- 3. the party ball rows (the "how many left" icons)
--
-- Those are a different mechanism again: BattleState:drawBallRow blits an
-- 8x8 quad out of assets/generated/battle/balls.png (4 tiles: healthy,
-- statused, fainted, empty slot) with a plain love.graphics.draw -- no
-- shader, and via a HARDCODED path rather than Assets.resolve. That last
-- detail matters: it means neither an assets_transforms recipe nor an
-- overrides/ folder can reach this image, because both are resolved through
-- Assets and this call bypasses it. So the row is recolored here instead.
--
-- The importer writes that PNG with decode2bpp(transparent = true), so its
-- pixels are exactly: GB shade 0 -> transparent, 1 -> 2/3 gray, 2 -> 1/3
-- gray, 3 -> black. Same three visible regions as the toss ball, so it gets
-- the same treatment: light -> white body, mid -> red top, black -> outline.
--
-- Per TILE, though, not per strip. The four tiles are SetupPokeballs' four
-- states (ball / status ball / fainted ball / empty), which is the whole
-- point of the row -- a healthy ball and a fainted one must not read alike.
-- Healthy keeps the red top, statused goes amber, fainted is desaturated,
-- and the empty socket is left exactly as the engine drew it.
--
-- WIDE LAYOUT ONLY, deliberately. In the OG layout drawHUDs renders onto
-- bgCanvas and the zone pass runs over it, and that shader keys off the RED
-- channel with the same 0.83/0.5/0.17 thresholds -- so a baked-in red
-- (r = 0.85) would read as "lightest" and come back out white. The OG layout
-- is left on vanilla behavior, where the zone pass colors the row as the
-- engine intends.

-- ------- 4. the Pokemon Center healing machine
--
-- A third mechanism. OverworldController's fxHeal() blits two 8x8 quads out
-- of Game.data.field.overworldFx.healMachine.path -- the monitor at y 0 and
-- the ball at y 8 -- with NO shader at all, so the raw DMG grays land on
-- screen. (The one time a shader IS bound is the jingle's blink beat, and
-- that explicitly sends PaletteFX.GRAYS, so even the flash is grayscale by
-- design.) The overworld's per-tile colorization never touches it either,
-- because the overlay draws after that pass.
--
-- fxHeal is a local inside a draw method, so it cannot be wrapped. The way
-- in is that it caches the image on the state and only loads it when
-- healMachineImg is nil -- so seeding that field with a recolored image
-- makes fxHeal use ours and never load the vanilla one. OverworldState:enter
-- is the seam: the module returns OverworldState, enter is an ordinary
-- method on it, and it runs on every map entry, so a seed that failed once
-- (data not ready yet) is simply retried on the next map.
--
-- Only the ball tile (y 8..15) is recolored; the monitor keeps its own art.
-- During the blink beat the balls still flash gray, since that shader runs
-- over whatever pixels it is given -- which reads as the machine flashing.

  -- ------- the VoxelMod battle-art fork's "ink flip"
  --
  -- absol89/DramaticShapeVoxelMod (the fork with 3D battles; confirmed
  -- against release 1.8.9) bakes the party HUD into an offscreen texture
  -- through this same drawHUDs -> drawBallRow chain, then runs a shader over
  -- the WHOLE bake that forces near-black pixels to white whenever the
  -- backdrop behind the panel reads dark -- so text stays legible over a
  -- cave floor or a night sky (lib/BattleHud.lua):
  --
  --   luma = dot(p.rgb, vec3(0.299, 0.587, 0.114))
  --   if (p.a > 0.0 && luma <= 0.35 * p.a) p.rgb = vec3(p.a)  -- -> white
  --
  -- The shader carves out one hardcoded exemption for the HP bar's fill
  -- cells. Nothing exempts the ball row -- it is not aware this mod exists.
  --
  -- ICONS' outline (24,24,24) has luma 0.094, nowhere near clear of 0.35: it
  -- gets flipped to white every time the backdrop is dark, which is what
  -- erases the ball's border. Healthy's red top (216,40,40) is luma 0.363 --
  -- 0.013 above the cutoff, a margin thin enough that any blending between
  -- the red and the (about to be white) outline pixel beside it, from
  -- whatever filtering the bake goes through, plausibly drags it under too.
  -- That reads as "the ball is grey and white."
  --
  -- ICONS_DRAMATIC gives every colour real headroom above 0.35 instead --
  -- outline lifted off near-black, healthy's red lightened toward coral --
  -- so nothing in the icon can be classified as ink, however dark the
  -- backdrop or however the bake gets filtered. Body colours (white,
  -- fainted-gray) were already luma 0.60+ and needed no change; statused's

  -- ------- why dramaticShapeShot is checked BEFORE wideLayout, not instead of
  --
  -- The 1.0.1 fix (an ink-safe palette gated the same way as the normal one,
  -- behind wideLayout()) did nothing: a diagnostic build confirmed the row
  -- was hitting the plain wideLayout()==false bailout, never reaching either
  -- palette at all.
  --
  -- The fork does not lie about that check -- it rewrites the truth. Its own
  -- source (lib/OverworldBattle.lua, OverworldBattle.forceOG):
  --
  --   if not opts or opts.battleLayout ~= "wide" then return false end
  --   opts.battleLayout = "og"
  --   if g.writeOptions then pcall(g.writeOptions, g) end
  --
  -- with the comment above it explaining why: "the OPTIONS menu takes the
  -- row off the list and pins the value while 3D-BTL is on ... a player is
  -- never offered a switch that gets reverted under them." So the moment
  -- 3D battle-art is turned on, battleLayout is permanently written to "og"
  -- on disk -- not a per-frame illusion, a real saved preference change --
  -- and wideLayout() answers false everywhere, forever, until 3D-BTL is
  -- turned back off.
  --
  -- That defeats the ORIGINAL reason this mod avoids OG at all: in real OG
  -- rendering, drawHUDs draws onto a canvas the zone-pass shader then
  -- remaps by red channel, and a baked-in red comes back white (see "Why
  -- the party rows are WIDE-layout only" in the README). But inside the
  -- fork's own HUD bake that shader never runs -- colorMode is forced false
  -- and nothing zone-passes the result -- so the danger the wideLayout
  -- gate exists to avoid simply is not present here. Checking
  -- dramaticShapeShot FIRST, and using it to color regardless of what
  -- battleLayout currently (truthfully, but irrelevantly) claims, is what
  -- fixes it: the wideLayout gate still protects real OG rendering below,
  -- for a battle that falls back to vanilla because no 3D arena was found
  -- for that map -- battleLayout stays "og" in that case too, and there the
  -- zone-pass danger is real again.

  -- ------- part 3b: the OG layout's party rows, drawn past the zone pass
  --
  -- In OG the row was green, not grey, and that was faithful: BATTLE_ZONES
  -- gives the whole HUD block -- name, level, HP bar AND the ball row -- one
  -- shared SGB zone, whose palette comes from sgbBattlePals()'s bar(), i.e.
  -- the HP BAR's palette (GREENBAR at full health). Real Super Game Boy
  -- Pokemon coloured that block exactly this way.
  --
  -- The mod used to just step aside for OG, because baking colour into the
  -- canvas is genuinely unsafe there: the zone shader keys off the RED
  -- channel, so a baked red comes back out white. Deferring sidesteps that
  -- entirely instead of fighting it. BattleState:draw's colorized path is:
  --
  --   setCanvas(bgCanvas); drawHUDs(); setCanvas(prev)
  --   drawZonePass(bgCanvas, sx, sy)   <- the greening happens here
  --   drawPicsLayer(...)               <- drawn after: keeps its own colours
  --   drawAnimLayer(true)              <- drawn after: keeps its own colours
  --
  -- so the engine already has a place where true colour survives, and the
  -- mon pics and the thrown ball both live there. The row is only green
  -- because it is baked in one step too early. So in OG the row is recorded
  -- rather than drawn (above), and replayed here immediately after the zone
  -- pass -- still before drawPicsLayer, so a pic that overlaps the row draws
  -- over it exactly as it did before.
  --
  -- The (sx, sy) shake offset is applied to match: the party rows are BG
  -- tiles, and drawZonePass blits the canvas at (sx, sy) when the window is
  -- shaking, so the row has to travel with it.
  --
  -- NOT tried: PaletteFX.markTrueColor(). It only appends to trueColorRects,
  -- which is consumed by Renderer's FRAME-level pass -- BattleState's own
  -- drawZonePass is a separate hardcoded BATTLE_ZONES loop that never
  -- consults it, so a mark would have been silently ignored here.
  --
  -- Deferring is gated on colorMode() because that is exactly the condition
  -- under which the zone pass runs: the flat fallback (no shader support)
  -- draws the HUD straight to the target and never calls drawZonePass, so a
  -- deferred row would have nothing to replay it and would simply vanish.
  -- There the mod still steps aside to vanilla.
