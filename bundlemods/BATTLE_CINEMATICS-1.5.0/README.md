*Stadium 2 Importer / Kenney Nature on Gen 2 · Colosseum Battle Environments / Orre Colosseum — provider presentation, BC camera direction.*



**Battle Cinematics (BC)** is the camera/director layer for battles. It brings the cinematic language of Pokémon Stadium into Recomp, then adapts that language around the presentation you choose: classic sprites, animated sprites, voxel worlds, genuine Stadium models and supported live battle hosts.

BC does **not** replace those renderers, models, animations or assets. It directs the camera around them, adapts to their presentation boundaries and can compose supported providers together without taking ownership of their content.

> **Stadium supplied the cinematography. BC supplied the camera system.**
>
> **BC directs. Providers present. Renderers render. Assets remain theirs.**

Stadium models are optional. Battle Cinematics is designed to make the presentation you already use look intentional from a moving cinematic camera.

> [!TIP]
> **v1.5 — Terrarium Advanced integration on [Gen2Recomped](https://github.com/UNDERdecoded/Gen2Recomped).** Coherent Colosseum action, reaction, faint and send-in presentation across the tested singles, doubles and explicit OVERWORLD routes, alongside BC's independently selected idle presets and supported PiP. [Release notes](https://github.com/EnterPlayerOne/Battle-Cinematics-Stadium-Camera/releases/tag/v1.5.0).

## v1.5 — Terrarium Advanced integration

**Terrarium Advanced 1.7.4 on [Gen2Recomped](https://github.com/UNDERdecoded/Gen2Recomped) is the focus of this release.** BC now works with the integrated Colosseum presentation as a complete battle sequence: real trainer throws and Pokémon send-ins, source-led attacks and recipient reactions, native fainting and replacements, then a return to your chosen Stadium 64, DW3 Classic or Hero Portrait idle direction.

On staged singles, BC preserves Terrarium's already-resolved combat camera instead of independently rebuilding its timing. Doubles keeps the accepted four-subject presentation and source-derived action cameras. The provider continues to own the models, animations, effects, environment and battle progression.

**Plug and play:** leave **ATTACK CAMERA → AUTO / STADIUM**. Supported Colosseum routes select the Colosseum treatment automatically; ordinary supported routes retain Stadium. Explicit OFF remains OFF, and existing settings are not rewritten. Faint Camera and the idle preset remain separate choices.

**Tested scope:** the Gen 1 cartridge path is the showcase/control on Gen2Recomped. Water and Pyrite singles were exercised through varied attacks, reactions, faint/replacement, personal send-ins and different intros. Water doubles with Phenac and its PiP compatibility notice, and an explicit CBE OVERWORLD Route 1 wild battle with PiP, were also confirmed. **Gen 2/Prism remains limited; Gen 3 operability varies by cartridge and host/provider build.** These results are not an all-generation or all-arena certification.

**Secondary View:** supported singles retain PiP, including the tested explicit OVERWORLD route. Real doubles intentionally suppresses PiP for that battle and shows a compatibility notice without changing the saved setting.

This is **not a new [Gen1Recomp](https://github.com/bryanthaboi/gen1recomp)/Deluxe port of Advanced Terrarium**, nor a claim that the distinct [upstream Terrarium](https://github.com/diegolix29/Terrarium) package has the same integration. Existing original-host BC support remains in the tables below. Standalone CBE/Overhaul/AIO parity and a true retail Colosseum idle preset are separate future work; the selectable idle presets here remain Stadium 64, DW3 Classic, Hero Portrait and External.

**Updating an already-working setup:** replace **BC only** and restart the host. Keep Terrarium 1.7.4, imported assets/cache and saved preferences. New users need a working Terrarium Advanced Colosseum presentation first; BC does not bundle or import its assets. Battle Intro and PiP remain OFF by default. Diagnostics can be switched OFF after testing.

---

## v1.4.4 — Stadium2 Overworld Models 0.4.33 Secondary View

**[Stadium2 Overworld Models](https://github.com/randyadr/Gen2-3D-Sprites) 0.4.33 is now runtime-validated with BC's modern live-world Secondary View on the tested Gen 2 path.** The PiP redraws the provider's actual voxel battle environment through an independent BC camera while retaining the live Stadium Pokémon and provider weather. The provider's battle HUD/command UI stays in the main view instead of being baked into the private PiP.

**The full BC sequence remains active.** Stadium 64 / DW3 / Hero idle direction, Pokémon Intro, BC Attack Camera and Faint Camera continue to sit above the provider's presentation when those BC phases are enabled. The provider retains its own right-stick/manual-camera behavior outside BC-owned phases.

**PiP interaction is retained on both input paths.** Touch drag and mouse drag were both runtime-confirmed after the clean live-world PiP fix. Existing custom placement and the v1.4.1 visible-PiP first-refusal behavior remain unchanged.

The new path is **capability-based rather than tied to the 0.4.33 version label**. Older Stadium2 Overworld Models paths keep their established alternate-eye behavior; modern builds exposing the wrapped Weather FX renderer plus safe scene capture/restore can use BC's bounded single-eye private render. No provider files are modified.

Performance was reported good in the accepted live-world test, including weather inside the PiP, but this release does not claim quantitative frame-time profiling or every provider setting combination. The provider's integrated StadiumBattleFX presentation remains provider-owned and is not changed or certified by BC v1.4.4.

**Updating:** replace BC only and restart Recomp. Existing settings remain intact. Secondary View still defaults OFF for new users.

---

## v1.4.3 — Stadium 2 Importer 0.14.4 Compatibility

**[Stadium 2 Importer](https://github.com/Deftones565/gen1recomp-mod-stadium2-importer) 0.14.4 is supported directly on the tested Gen 1 and Gen 2 paths.** Kenney/custom environments and native Stadium/test arenas once again keep BC's main camera, live Pokémon and independent Secondary View together. Gen 1 PiP engagement, Gen 2 environment framing, native-arena camera alignment and matching PiP backgrounds are restored.

**Older proven setups remain supported.** BC selects the relevant Importer integration from the scene/camera capabilities it actually needs, rather than rejecting it solely because the release label changed. Direct **0.14.2** and **0.14.0**, and the separately documented older hosted routes, retain their own established scope. This is not blanket certification of future releases or every mixed-provider combination.

**Weather stays in the main view.** Importer continues to own its weather; BC's private PiP intentionally omits it, keeping the alternate view focused on the Pokémon without running another weather simulation.

**Phenac Stadium starts closer.** The shorter inward approach first used with [CBE](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Battle-Environments-1.0-BETA) is now the shared standard on already-supported Phenac paths. The full **13.2-second** sequence, later choreography and A/B handoff remain intact. Existing stage-admission and structural-safety limits still apply.

**Also retained:** [v1.4.2's real-arena CBE PiP](https://github.com/EnterPlayerOne/Battle-Cinematics-Stadium-Camera/releases/tag/v1.4.2) within its documented validation scope, plus [v1.4.1's desktop PiP dragging and Prism FRONT-facing correction](https://github.com/EnterPlayerOne/Battle-Cinematics-Stadium-Camera/releases/tag/v1.4.1).

**Updating:** replace BC only and restart Recomp. Keep your provider archives, imported assets/cache and saved settings. **Initial Delay remains 2 seconds. Battle Intro and Secondary View remain OFF for new users.**

**Earlier Kenney showcase:** [Kenney Nature — Gen 1](media/Battle_Cinematics_Stadium_2_Importer_014_Kenney_Nature_Gen1.gif)

*This is the earlier Gen 1 Kenney Nature showcase.*

## v1.4.0 — Gen2Recomped

Battle Cinematics now supports **[Gen2Recomped](https://github.com/UNDERdecoded/Gen2Recomped)** through UNDERdecoded's bundled **Dramatic Shapes** presentation layer while remaining the same single official BC package used on **[Gen1Recomp](https://github.com/bryanthaboi/gen1recomp)** / GoldRecomp.

Runtime-validated on **Gen2Recomped 0.7.49** with the **Dramatic Shapes 0.7.47 release payload** (the provider currently reports `0.7.40` in its manifest/in-game):

- **RBY / Gen 1**
- **Gold / Silver / Crystal / Gen 2**
- **Prism / Gen 2**
- **Emerald / Gen 3**

Validated BC features include **Pokémon Intro, Stadium/DW3/Hero idle direction, Attack Camera, Faint Camera, Dynamic 4-Way Sprite View, provider-native structural safety, and bounded Secondary View/PiP with resolution-invariant framing**.

> [!NOTE]
> **Prism and Emerald remain alpha host cartridges.** Structural safety is deliberately conservative in this first integration, especially in Prism caves; an authored Pokémon Intro may shorten, hold or fall back when the provider geometry says the route is obstructed. Results can vary by location. Prism's longer send-in delay is provider-owned.

> [!NOTE]
> **Phenac Stadium is intentionally hidden/disabled on the Gen2Recomped Dramatic Shapes host.** The validated encounter-level Phenac opening remains available on its established Gen1Recomp / GoldRecomp provider paths. Ordinary **Pokémon Intro remains available** on Gen2Recomped.

**Polished Crystal is not claimed yet** because the current host does not expose it as an importable runtime cartridge in the tested build.

---

## v1.3.2 — Battle Art / Legendary Compatibility

**[Battle Art Voxel Fork](https://github.com/absol89/DramaticShapeVoxelMod) 1.10.8 and the current Legendary visual stack are fully runtime-validated with official Battle Cinematics on Gen 1.** The normal BC camera suite remains active across Battle Art environments, including the Legendary cave presentation: passive presets, Pokémon Intro, Attack and Faint cameras, 4-Way Sprite View and Secondary View all retain their established roles.

**Caves do not require a fixed one-side camera lock.** Battle Art owns its cave geometry and clearance rules; BC keeps its authored cinematography and adapts through the supported presentation instead of replacing the battle with a permanent side view.

**No separate Battle Cinematics compatibility fork is required for this tested stack.** Install the current official Battle Cinematics release alongside Battle Art 1.10.8 and the Legendary visuals you want to use. Battle Art and Legendary assets remain provider-owned; BC remains the camera/director layer.

This is a **compatibility-certification release**. Runtime camera behaviour is unchanged from v1.3.1 apart from release/version identity. The broader 2D-card live-state Secondary View enhancement remains pinned for a later cross-host pass rather than being patched specifically for Battle Art.

> [!NOTE]
> This v1.3.2 certification is for **Battle Art Voxel Fork 1.10.8 / Legendary on Gen 1**. Battle Art Gen2 is a separately versioned provider and retains its own exact compatibility row and test status.

---

## v1.3.1 — Stadium 2 Importer 0.14.2 + Native Stadium Arenas

**[Stadium 2 Importer](https://github.com/Deftones565/gen1recomp-mod-stadium2-importer) 0.14.2 is now validated directly with Battle Cinematics on Gen 1 and Gen 2.** Kenney/custom environments, native test fields and gym test arenas keep the main camera, live battler and matching Secondary View background together. The Importer owns the environments, models, animation and renderer; BC supplies the enabled camera direction and independent PiP composition.

Native Stadium arenas now use their actual battler positions, field scale and presentation bounds. BC's main view sits lower and closer instead of spending the composition on empty floor, while PiP frames the Pokémon at native-arena scale rather than looking above it. **The accepted Kenney framing is preserved.** Gen 1 PiP engagement and the reported Gen 2 black-frame flicker are corrected in the validated 0.14.2 paths.

**Phenac Stadium now runs on the tested Gen 2 provider-selected environment and native arena stages.** BC checks the live stage selection rather than rejecting a self-contained arena based on the original overworld map. Classic-scene safety and the separate live-world indoor restrictions remain unchanged. Gen 1 Phenac retains its accepted behaviour.

The v1.3.0 Colosseum foundation is retained: [Colosseum Battle Environments](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Battle-Environments-1.0-BETA) 2.0 and [Colosseum Overhaul](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Inspired-UI-Overhaul-V.1.0.0) 1.0 on both generations, BC PRIORITY with the regular CBE camera ON or OFF, native Attack timing and runtime doubles arbitration. The arena-themed PiP cards shipped at that time are replaced by real resident-arena rendering on these exact packages in v1.4.2. See the current CBE setup below rather than historical Auto Battle Flow instructions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is direct Importer **0.14.2** validation, not an automatic upgrade of every mixed-provider stack or a collision-free certification of every field. The separately reported Gen 2 Importer + Colosseum UI overlay conflict was reproduced on **0.14.0** with BC disabled; that UI stack is not recertified on 0.14.2 here.

**Battle Intro and Secondary View remain OFF for new users.** Existing saved BC choices remain intact.

## What Battle Cinematics changes during a battle

BC is modular. Use the complete presentation or only the camera phases you want.

| Battle moment | Battle Cinematics |
|---|---|
| **Idle / command menu** | Stadium 64, DW3 Classic, Hero Portrait or External host camera |
| **Flat sprites** | Camera-aware **4-Way Sprite View** where supported |
| **Battle opening** | Optional PHENAC STADIUM, independently assigned to Wild, Trainer, Gym Leader, Elite Four, Champion and Rival battles |
| **Pokémon send-in** | BC Hero FULL / COMPACT on established routes; provider trainer throw → source-derived resident reveal on supported Terrarium Colosseum routes |
| **Moves** | AUTO / STADIUM selects the supported host treatment; Terrarium Colosseum uses its source-led combat lifecycle while ordinary hosts retain Stadium |
| **Faint** | Dedicated defeated-Pokémon presentation; supported Terrarium staged singles follows the provider's native faint camera and handoff |
| **Secondary view** | Optional independent PiP camera with **LIVE VIEW**, **LIVING PORTRAIT** or **DYNAMIC (DW3)** presentation |
| **PiP quality** | Independent internal render resolution from **160x90 through 1280x720** |
| **PiP appearance** | Independent ROUNDED / COLOSSEUM frame and WHITE / DARK / COLOSSEUM GREY border |
| **Stadium 2 Importer arena** | Optional **LIVE VOXEL ARENA** override where a compatible live-world provider is actually available |
| **Manual camera** | BC-owned on Gen 1 and on CBE in both generations; other Gen 2 providers retain their own control |

The core rule underneath all of it is:

> **Every BC option produces a good, readable battle everywhere, with BC free to gracefully degrade its physical camera language when the environment cannot support it.**

---

# Compatibility

Battle Cinematics is a director, not a battle renderer. A supported presentation host still owns the world, sprites, models and animation it provides.

**v1.5 scope:** the new Terrarium Advanced integration below is separate from the retained original-host and bundled-Dramatic matrices. A check mark in one provider/host row does not certify another. The latest Terrarium runtime confirmation is the Gen 1 showcase/control path on the user's tested Gen2Recomped setup; its host APK version was not pinned in this release record. Terrarium Advanced itself is pinned exactly to **1.7.4**.

**Retained v1.4.4 compatibility:** **[Stadium2 Overworld Models](https://github.com/randyadr/Gen2-3D-Sprites) 0.4.33** now has runtime-accepted modern live-world Secondary View on the tested Gen 2 path: live voxel environment, live Stadium Pokémon, provider weather, provider UI excluded from the private PiP, and both touch/mouse PiP dragging retained. Direct [Stadium 2 Importer](https://github.com/Deftones565/gen1recomp-mod-stadium2-importer) **0.14.4 / 0.14.2 / 0.14.0**, **[Gen2Recomped](https://github.com/UNDERdecoded/Gen2Recomped) 0.7.49 + [Dramatic Shapes](https://github.com/UNDERdecoded/Gen2Recomped/releases/tag/v0.7.47) 0.7.47 release payload**, **[Battle Art Voxel Fork](https://github.com/absol89/DramaticShapeVoxelMod) 1.10.8 + the current Legendary visual stack**, [CBE](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Battle-Environments-1.0-BETA) 2.0 and [Colosseum Overhaul](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Inspired-UI-Overhaul-V.1.0.0) 1.0 retain their accepted scope and caveats below. Other rows keep their own exact version pins and limits.

**Key:** ✅ = validated within the row’s stated host, generation and setup; ⚠️ = the recorded partial / re-audit status, not a new compatibility pass. **3D yield** means 4-Way Sprite View correctly leaves genuine 3D models alone; it is not a camera failure.

**Main BC Cameras** does not promise full Phenac on every map. Full Phenac is available on supported [CBE](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Battle-Environments-1.0-BETA) stages, explicit Importer **HOST DEFAULT** stages, the validated direct Importer 0.14.4 selected environment/native-arena stages, and recognised outdoor live maps. Other live-world interiors and unknown map contexts keep their existing safeguards and ordinary Pokémon Intro/other cameras. A provider-selected cave environment is not the same contract as an unverified live overworld cave.

**v1.4.2 live-arena scope:** the exact [Colosseum Battle Environments](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Battle-Environments-1.0-BETA) **2.0** and [Colosseum Overhaul](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Inspired-UI-Overhaul-V.1.0.0) **1.0** packages share the new resident-arena PiP adapter. New runtime validation is the **Gen 2 / combined Overhaul 1.0** setup recorded in **Orre Colosseum and Outskirts**. Existing main-camera support on both generations is retained; the new arena draw was not separately device-tested on Gen 1, standalone CBE or every catalogue venue.

**Recorded setup:** [Gen1Recomp](https://github.com/bryanthaboi/gen1recomp) **0.2.54 / Gen 2**, [Colosseum Overhaul](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Inspired-UI-Overhaul-V.1.0.0) **1.0**, and **Battle Art Voxel Gen2** (version not restated). Set **COLOSSEUM BATTLE CAMERA OFF**. **AUTO BATTLE FLOW can remain enabled** in this tested setup; the older blanket OFF instruction is superseded. This is a settings-record correction, not a new battle-flow arbitration change.

### Desktop mouse PiP placement — v1.4.1

**Desktop:** left-click inside the visible PiP, drag it to a new position, then release to save **CUSTOM** placement. BC captures that gesture even when the presentation provider normally uses the mouse to steer its battle camera. Mouse camera handling outside the PiP is left alone and resumes after release. Existing touch placement is unchanged.

| Desktop runtime / game | Presentation provider | Validation scope |
|---|---|---|
| [Gen1Recomp](https://github.com/bryanthaboi/gen1recomp) / Gen 1 | [Dramaless Shape](https://github.com/artyrambles/DRAMALESS_SHAPE) | Mouse grab, drag and saved placement validated. |
| [Gen1Recomp](https://github.com/bryanthaboi/gen1recomp) **0.2.53** / Crystal | [Stadium2 Overworld Models](https://github.com/randyadr/Gen2-3D-Sprites) **0.2.81** | PiP drag works alongside the provider's mouse-controlled battle camera; provider control resumes after release. |
| [Gen2Recomped](https://github.com/UNDERdecoded/Gen2Recomped) / Prism | [Dramatic Shapes](https://github.com/UNDERdecoded/Gen2Recomped/releases/tag/v0.7.47) **0.7.47 release payload** | PiP drag and provider mouse-camera coexistence validated. The inherited host validation basis is 0.7.49; the provider manifest reports 0.7.40. |

These are input-interaction checks, not a fresh certification of every provider's renderer or animation. **v1.4.4 adds a separate runtime confirmation for [Stadium2 Overworld Models](https://github.com/randyadr/Gen2-3D-Sprites) 0.4.33:** the clean live-world PiP remains draggable by both touch and mouse on the tested Gen 2 path.

## Gen2Recomped host

The same `BATTLE_CINEMATICS` package is used on [Gen2Recomped](https://github.com/UNDERdecoded/Gen2Recomped); it is not a separate BC product. **Terrarium Advanced** and the bundled **Dramatic Shapes** presentation below are different provider paths.

### Terrarium Advanced 1.7.4 — new v1.5 scope

| Route on Gen2Recomped | State | Evidence and boundary |
|---|---|---|
| **Gen 1 showcase/control — staged singles** | ✅ Accepted | Water and Pyrite: full attack/reaction, faint/replacement, personal send-ins, varied moves and different intros. No promise that every venue/encounter was tested. |
| **Gen 1 showcase/control — doubles** | ✅ Accepted | Water and Pyrite source-camera treatment accepted; final regression confirmed Water + Phenac and the intentional PiP notice. Stadium/DW3/Hero supports real four-slot idle subjects. |
| **Gen 1 — explicit CBE OVERWORLD single** | ✅ Accepted | Route 1 wild battle and PiP confirmed on the final runtime parent. This selected arena is not the same mode as arenas OFF. |
| **Gen 2 / Crystal / Prism** | ⚠️ Limited | Earlier singles results exist, but current host menu/rival-flow and provider differences limit usable validation. No fresh all-cartridge or doubles pass is claimed. |
| **Gen 3 / Emerald** | ⚠️ Variable / partial | Earlier singles AUTO/STADIUM + PiP and doubles controls worked. Provider wobble and missing trainer throw were recorded. Not a fresh final-runtime full-generation pass. |
| **Gen 3 / FireRed** | ⚠️ Variable / partial | Earlier singles worked; the doubles black overlay was reproduced with BC disabled. No claim that this release repairs that provider/host issue. |
| **Other Gen 3 cartridges / combinations** | — Not certified | Do not inherit FireRed or Emerald results merely from a generation label. |
| **Advanced Terrarium on Gen1Recomp/Deluxe** | — Not a supported v1.5 transfer | Distinct runtime/provider contracts and recorded save/load problems. Not interchangeable with upstream Terrarium. |

**Provider identity:** the tested ZIP is `Terrarium.Advance.Mod.1.7.4.zip` (mod ID `DRAMATIC_SHAPE`, display name `Advanced Terrarium Voxel Mod`, manifest version `1.7.4`). Its SHA-256 is `339d87e28bd87176d1e6cc5ac0acf64da8868b0552a741f154ed7841e1185f8f`. A canonical public download URL for these exact bytes was not established in this release preparation; the distinct [upstream Terrarium](https://github.com/diegolix29/Terrarium) link is attribution, not a replacement download for Advanced 1.7.4.

**Phenac, Boss Intro and BASIC:** on this integrated route, an active provider Boss Intro takes priority; otherwise a selected full BC intro can run, with the accepted moving BASIC establishing treatment as the applicable fallback. They are not stacked. Manual first-enemy resident reveal retains **A = CONTINUE / B = SKIP**; AUTO BATTLE FLOW does not acquire that manual hold.

**PiP policy:** singles uses the supported bounded second view. Actual doubles intentionally shows a compatibility notice and suppresses PiP for that battle, preserving the saved ON setting. Field-wide/multi-target reaction presentation follows the provider's aggregate lifecycle, not independent per-target simulations. Audio/cry behaviour and game logic remain provider/host-owned.

### Bundled Dramatic Shapes — retained v1.4.x scope

This older validation is specifically **Gen2Recomped 0.7.49 + [Dramatic Shapes](https://github.com/UNDERdecoded/Gen2Recomped/releases/tag/v0.7.47) 0.7.47 release payload**, whose internal provider version still reads `0.7.40`. It is not the Terrarium Advanced matrix above and does not expand that matrix's cartridge coverage.

| Cartridge | Main BC Cameras | 4-Way Sprite View | Secondary View | Current state |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| **RBY / Gen 1** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Validated. Fixed-FRONT PiP portrait + live voxel world; some location-specific foreground/prop occlusion can remain. |
| **GSC / Crystal / Gen 2** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Validated. Correct cross-host sprite scaling and PiP handedness. |
| **Prism / Gen 2** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | **Alpha host cartridge.** Structural safety is intentionally conservative, especially in caves; Intro travel may shorten/hold/fallback. Provider send-in delay remains provider-owned. **v1.4.1:** player FRONT handedness is corrected in main Dynamic 4-Way; BACK, enemy and PiP orientation are unchanged. |
| **Emerald / Gen 3** | ✅ retained; Attack ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | **Alpha host cartridge.** The established Gen3 lifecycle, Dynamic representation, Faint, structural safety and PiP foundation is retained. **Follow-up report: Attack Camera can be ineffectual on Emerald; unresolved and not fixed or recertified by v1.4.3.** The earlier Attack validation is not a blanket guarantee for this later report. Native low-resolution sprite art remains pixel art even at higher PiP raster resolutions. |
| **Polished Crystal** | — | — | — | Not currently claimable/importable in the tested host build. |

**Battle Intro / Phenac Stadium remains intentionally unavailable on this bundled Dramatic Shapes route.** That restriction does not apply to the separately validated Terrarium Advanced path above, or remove Phenac from its established [Gen1Recomp](https://github.com/bryanthaboi/gen1recomp) / GoldRecomp integrations.

## Gen 1 / RBY

**Retained original-host provider scope:** these rows are not a new Terrarium Advanced/Deluxe certification and were not all re-smoked for v1.5.

| Presentation / host | Main BC Cameras | 4-Way Sprite View | Secondary View | [Stadium 2 Importer](https://github.com/Deftones565/gen1recomp-mod-stadium2-importer) / arena notes |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| **[Stadium 2 Importer](https://github.com/Deftones565/gen1recomp-mod-stadium2-importer) 0.14.4 — direct Gen 1** | ✅ | 3D yield | ✅ | Updated direct path runtime-accepted with proper PiP across the tested Importer environments/arenas. Kenney/custom and native/test arena presentation retain live battler/APB framing and matching backgrounds. Main weather remains provider-owned; the private PiP intentionally omits weather. |
| **[Stadium 2 Importer](https://github.com/Deftones565/gen1recomp-mod-stadium2-importer) 0.14.2 — direct Gen 1** | ✅ | 3D yield | ✅ | **Retained validation.** Kenney/custom environments, test fields and gym test arenas validated. Native main-camera height/framing, live battler/APB PiP and matching backgrounds corrected. Gen 1 PiP engagement and Phenac retained. No automatic certification of older mixed-provider stacks. |
| **[Colosseum Battle Environments](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Battle-Environments-1.0-BETA) 2.0 — Gen 1** | ✅ | 3D yield (native models) | ⚠️ New live-arena draw: separate runtime check pending | Prior main-camera/Intro/Attack/Faint/manual support is retained. The exact package now uses the shared real-arena PiP adapter and inward Phenac approach; new runtime evidence is from **Gen 2 + combined Overhaul 1.0**, not a separate run of this row. No per-arena clearance guarantee. BC PRIORITY and the existing phase ownership remain; DOUBLE BATTLES may stay enabled, but actual admitted doubles remain CBE-owned. |
| **[Colosseum Overhaul](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Inspired-UI-Overhaul-V.1.0.0) 1.0 — Gen 1** | ✅ | 3D yield (native models) | ⚠️ New live-arena draw: separate runtime check pending | Prior Gen 1 main-camera/Intro/Attack/Faint/manual support is retained. The exact combined CBE 2.0 + UI package uses the shared real-arena PiP adapter. New real-arena runtime evidence is from **Gen 2 / combined Overhaul 1.0**, not a separate Gen 1 run. BC PRIORITY and phase ownership remain; actual admitted doubles stay provider-owned. |
| **[Colosseum Battle Environments](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Battle-Environments-1.0-BETA) 1.8.4 — Gen 1** | ✅ | 3D yield (native models) | ✅; reaction caveat | Retained exact-stock adapter (`1.8.4-capture-member-hsd.1`). Keep **COLOSSEUM CAMERA OFF**. Primary cameras, intros, manual control and portable-actor PiP retained; Gen 1 PiP reactions can be less consistent than Gen 2. |
| **[Dramaless Shape](https://github.com/artyrambles/DRAMALESS_SHAPE) 2.0.4** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Vanilla / Crystal / Importer validated. **LIVE VOXEL ARENA** supported. Provider-native bounded manual fallback retained for the Dramaless + Importer combination. v1.2.6 performance verified. |
| **[Battle Art Voxel Fork](https://github.com/absol89/DramaticShapeVoxelMod) 1.10.8 + Legendary visuals** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | **Full tested Gen 1 host compatibility.** Vanilla / animated Gen 5 cards and the current Legendary environment stack are validated with BC. Caves retain normal BC choreography rather than requiring a permanent one-side lock. Battle Art owns its world, cards and environment safety; BC keeps camera direction. The separate cross-host 2D PiP live-state enhancement is pinned for later and is not a Battle Art-specific compatibility patch. |
| **[Official Dramatic Shape](https://github.com/DramaticShape/DramaticShapeVoxelMod) 1.6.1 — Gen 1 MAP / A** | ✅ | Inherited supported flat-card path | Functional; stale-environment concern remains | **LIVE VOXEL ARENA** replaces Importer blue. Hosted world is bounded to 960×540 maximum, preserving aspect; Importer actors/HUD remain full-resolution. Android main-world performance improvement validated. B/disc modes yield to host. |
| **[Voxel Ascendant](https://github.com/Roxas2712/voxel-ascendant) 2.0.2 — MAP** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Vanilla / Crystal / Importer MAP validated. **LIVE VOXEL ARENA** supported. ARENA / DISCS are not currently claimed. |
| **[PotatoVoxel](https://github.com/ShaneMcGovernIE/potato_voxel) 1.9.6 — Gen 1 MAP / 2D-3D A** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Gen 1 validated with [Stadium 2 Importer](https://github.com/Deftones565/gen1recomp-mod-stadium2-importer) **LIVE VOXEL ARENA**. v1.2.6 main/PiP APB framing, passive paths and one-world performance verified. |
| **Voxel Ultimate 1.0.7 — Gen 1** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Integrated host path validated. Avoid stacking duplicate systems that Voxel Ultimate already integrates. |
| **[Stadium 2 Importer](https://github.com/Deftones565/gen1recomp-mod-stadium2-importer) 0.14.0 — direct Gen 1** | ✅ | 3D yield | ✅ | Direct 0.14 owned-scene path validated. **LIVE VIEW** uses the live Stadium actor in a bounded independent scene. **KENNEY NATURE** is runtime-validated in the main view and PiP; BC preserves its own portrait framing while the provider owns the woodland environment. |
| **[Crystal Animated Sprites](https://github.com/distilledorion-sketch/crystal_animated_sprites_with_shiny_visuals) 2.0.2** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Animated sprite presentation supported on established compatible host paths. Fixed animated FRONT Secondary View remains independent from the main 4-Way view. |
| **Compatible vanilla / ROM sprite presentation** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ where host-supported | BC uses the host's actual sprite presentation rather than replacing the artwork. |
| **[StadiumBattleFX](https://github.com/anxiousintrovert/StadiumBattleFX) 2.1.8.1** | ✅* | 3D yield | ✅ | **Gen1 Stadium model presentation supported.** Proven with **[Dramaless Shape](https://github.com/artyrambles/DRAMALESS_SHAPE) 2.0.3** when SBFX `BATTLE ARENA` is set to the registered **VOXEL ARENA** provider. Other voxel-provider combinations are provider/version-specific; see notes below. |

## Gen 2 / GSC

| Presentation / host | Main BC Cameras | 4-Way Sprite View | Secondary View | Current state |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| **[Stadium 2 Importer](https://github.com/Deftones565/gen1recomp-mod-stadium2-importer) 0.14.4 — direct Gen 2** | ✅ | 3D yield | ✅ | Updated direct path runtime-accepted. Kenney/custom environment framing, native/test arena main-camera alignment, live battler/APB PiP and matching backgrounds are restored. **Phenac runs on admitted provider-selected environment/native-arena stages**; classic map safety remains intact. |
| **[Stadium 2 Importer](https://github.com/Deftones565/gen1recomp-mod-stadium2-importer) 0.14.2 — direct Gen 2** | ✅ | 3D yield | ✅ | **Retained validation.** Kenney/custom environments, test fields and gym test arenas validated. Native main-camera height/framing, live battler/APB PiP and matching backgrounds corrected. Reported black PiP flicker corrected. **Phenac runs on validated provider-selected environment/native-arena stages**; classic map safety remains intact. No automatic certification of older mixed-provider stacks. |
| **[Colosseum Battle Environments](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Battle-Environments-1.0-BETA) 2.0 — Gen 2** | ✅ | 3D yield (native models) | ⚠️ New live-arena draw: separate runtime check pending | Prior main-camera/Intro/Attack/Faint/manual support is retained. The exact package now uses the shared real-arena PiP adapter and inward Phenac approach; new runtime evidence is from **Gen 2 + combined Overhaul 1.0**, not a separate run of this row. No per-arena clearance guarantee. BC PRIORITY and the existing phase ownership remain; DOUBLE BATTLES may stay enabled, but actual admitted doubles remain CBE-owned. |
| **[Colosseum Overhaul](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Inspired-UI-Overhaul-V.1.0.0) 1.0 — Gen 2** | ✅ | 3D yield (native models) | ✅ **Real arena verified** | Real arena + portable player PiP runtime-verified in Orre Colosseum and Outskirts on Gen1Recomp 0.2.54 with Battle Art Voxel Gen2. Use **COLOSSEUM BATTLE CAMERA OFF**; **AUTO BATTLE FLOW can remain enabled** in this setup. Independent portrait framing and live attack presentation retained. No new all-arena, Boss Intro or actual-doubles test is claimed. BC PRIORITY and the existing phase ownership remain; DOUBLE BATTLES may stay enabled, but actual admitted doubles remain CBE-owned. |
| **[Colosseum Battle Environments](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Battle-Environments-1.0-BETA) 1.8.4 — Gen 2** | ✅ | 3D yield (native models) | ✅ | Retained exact-stock adapter (`1.8.4-capture-member-hsd.1`). Keep **COLOSSEUM CAMERA OFF**. Primary cameras, intros, manual control and bounded portable-actor PiP retained. |
| **Battle Art Voxel Gen2 2.0.8 / `BATTLE_ART_VOXEL_GEN2`** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Validated Battle Art Gen2 host. Passive presets, 4-Way, Pokémon Intro/send-ins, faint lifecycle and APB framing retained. With [Stadium 2 Importer](https://github.com/Deftones565/gen1recomp-mod-stadium2-importer) 0.12.1 MODELS ON, LIVE VIEW uses the live Stadium actor over the Battle Art voxel world; with MODELS OFF, Secondary View uses the established fixed-FRONT vanilla portrait path. Native close actor spacing can naturally limit aggressive Attack Camera travel. |
| **[Stadium2 Overworld Models](https://github.com/randyadr/Gen2-3D-Sprites) / `STADIUM2_OVERWORLD_MODELS` 0.4.33** | ✅ | 3D yield / ✅ on supported 2D path | ✅ **Live world verified** | v1.4.4 runtime-accepted on the tested Gen 2 live-world path: full BC sequence including Attack Camera, live voxel environment + Stadium Pokémon + provider weather in Secondary View, provider battle UI excluded from the private PiP, acceptable reported performance, and both touch/mouse PiP drag confirmed. Provider owns ordinary right-stick/manual control. Integrated StadiumBattleFX visuals are provider-owned and not certified by this BC release. |
| **[Stadium2 Overworld Models](https://github.com/randyadr/Gen2-3D-Sprites) / `STADIUM2_OVERWORLD_MODELS` 0.2.81** | ✅ | ✅ on 2D world-card path | ✅ retained historical path | Earlier validated alternate-eye / world-card foundation retained. v1.4.4 does not require the modern Weather FX renderer or 0.4.33 release label for this older supported route. Provider owns Gen 2 right-stick behavior. |
| **Voxel Ultimate 1.0.7 — Gen 2** | ⚠️ **Re-audit** | ✅ on supported flat-card path | ⚠️ **Re-audit** | Previously established integrated Gen 2 host. Current 3D attachment and complete continuous LIVE VIEW behavior are entering renewed runtime audit. |
| **[Stadium 2 Importer](https://github.com/Deftones565/gen1recomp-mod-stadium2-importer) 0.14.0 — direct Gen 2** | ✅ | 3D yield | ✅ | Direct Gold/Gen2 0.14 presentation validated with BC. **KENNEY NATURE** is inherited by the private LIVE VIEW scene while BC reasserts the established independent portrait camera after environment selection. The live actor/Attack lifecycle and main Kenney camera remain separate. **Colosseum UI + Importer 0.14 Gen2 currently has an external provider/UI overlay conflict even with BC disabled.** |
| **[PotatoVoxel](https://github.com/ShaneMcGovernIE/potato_voxel) 1.9.6 + [Stadium 2 Importer](https://github.com/Deftones565/gen1recomp-mod-stadium2-importer) 0.12.1** | ⚠️ **Re-audit** | 3D yield | ⚠️ **Re-audit** | Potato standalone Gen 2 3D is not claimed. Any working combined presentation remains Importer-owned because Potato does not currently expose an attached Gen 2 live voxel world. |
| **[Crystal Animated Sprites](https://github.com/distilledorion-sketch/crystal_animated_sprites_with_shiny_visuals) 2.0.2** | ✅ | ✅ on compatible world-card paths | ✅ | Crystal artwork/animation remains provider-owned; BC supplies camera-relative orientation and secondary composition where supported. |

## Provider setup and limitations

### Terrarium Advanced 1.7.4 setup

Start with the tested **Terrarium Advanced 1.7.4** presentation working in [Gen2Recomped](https://github.com/UNDERdecoded/Gen2Recomped), including the provider's required Colosseum import. BC does not provide the game, disc, models or caches. Keep the known working provider configuration when updating BC.

```text
CAMERA AUTHORITY       BC PRIORITY
ATTACK CAMERA         AUTO / STADIUM
FAINT CAMERA          ON
PKMN INTRO CAM        BC HERO
IDLE PRESET           Stadium 64 / DW3 Classic / Hero Portrait
```

**No manual COLOSSEUM selection is required.** AUTO / STADIUM resolves the supported Colosseum route automatically and retains Stadium on ordinary supported hosts. Explicit Attack OFF remains an opt-out. Faint Camera remains independent. To keep provider idle while retaining enabled phase modules, use **EXTERNAL**.

For a full BC opening, separately enable **BATTLE INTRO** and select **PHENAC STADIUM** for the desired battle category. An active provider Boss Intro has priority on this integrated route. The first enemy resident reveal in manual-flow staged trainer singles can hold for **A CONTINUE / B SKIP**; automatic flow remains ungated by that manual acknowledgement. Trainer throws, attacks and faint animations are not fabricated or replayed by BC.

| Terrarium route | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Selected ordinary CBE arena** | Staged Colosseum presentation; final singles controls were Water and Pyrite. |
| **Explicit CBE OVERWORLD** | A selected Colosseum arena using live-world geometry. Final Route 1 wild singles + PiP accepted; it uses the staged-family source-first integration. |
| **Arenas OFF / live voxel / COLOSSEUM A/B** | Separate established provider route. Do not treat the explicit OVERWORLD pass as a fresh all-map or all-mode test of this route. |

For singles PiP, enable **SECOND VIEW PIP** and begin with **320×180**. In actual doubles the compatibility notice and absent PiP are intentional. Neither requires clearing preferences. Terrarium's real actor scale is respected, including its 1.7.4 OVERWORLD presentation; BC adds no guessed global scale multiplier.

The standalone CBE setup below is retained for its own exact packages. **Do not copy its older CAMERA OFF/Boss/doubles instructions onto the integrated Terrarium Advanced path.**

### Stadium2 Overworld Models 0.4.33 live-world Secondary View

On the validated modern Gen 2 path, BC treats [Stadium2 Overworld Models](https://github.com/randyadr/Gen2-3D-Sprites) as the presentation/world owner and redraws the provider's current live battle scene through a bounded independent PiP camera. The private pass keeps the voxel environment, Stadium Pokémon and provider weather, but temporarily withholds the provider's battle HUD/command UI so it is not duplicated inside BC's PiP.

This is still **one battle state → two cameras → two bounded views**. BC does not start a second battle or advance a second simulation. Touch and mouse PiP placement remain available. Older provider builds retain their established alternate-eye path rather than being forced through the modern wrapped-render route.

### CBE presentation

The exact [Colosseum Battle Environments](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Battle-Environments-1.0-BETA) **2.0** / [Colosseum Overhaul](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Inspired-UI-Overhaul-V.1.0.0) **1.0** integrations render their **real resident arena** behind BC's existing portable PiP player. This is a bounded independent camera view, not a crop of the main screen, a painted theme or a second battle simulation. APB-aware subject size, LEFT/RIGHT, NORMAL/CLOSE and gentle independent pan are preserved.

**v1.4.2 live-arena scope:** the exact [Colosseum Battle Environments](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Battle-Environments-1.0-BETA) **2.0** and [Colosseum Overhaul](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Inspired-UI-Overhaul-V.1.0.0) **1.0** packages share the new resident-arena PiP adapter. New runtime validation is the **Gen 2 / combined Overhaul 1.0** setup recorded in **Orre Colosseum and Outskirts**. Existing main-camera support on both generations is retained; the new arena draw was not separately device-tested on Gen 1, standalone CBE or every catalogue venue.

**Recorded setup:** [Gen1Recomp](https://github.com/bryanthaboi/gen1recomp) **0.2.54 / Gen 2**, [Colosseum Overhaul](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Inspired-UI-Overhaul-V.1.0.0) **1.0**, and **Battle Art Voxel Gen2** (version not restated). Set **COLOSSEUM BATTLE CAMERA OFF**. **AUTO BATTLE FLOW can remain enabled** in this tested setup; the older blanket OFF instruction is superseded. This is a settings-record correction, not a new battle-flow arbitration change.

The older **CBE 1.8.4** integration keeps its themed-card PiP and legacy **COLOSSEUM CAMERA OFF** requirement. Use the exact supported, source-checked packages; later provider bytes are not automatically certified. The new live-arena route withholds a frame if its source/scene/render contract is unavailable rather than displaying a synthetic or stale replacement.

<a id="stadium-2-importer-0142-direct-presentation"></a>

### Stadium 2 Importer 0.14.4 direct presentation

Direct Importer **0.14.4** is runtime-accepted with BC on the tested Gen 1 and Gen 2 paths. BC now admits the established direct integration from the actual scene-camera capabilities it consumes rather than a short release-label allowlist. The provider's selected environment and arena remain provider-owned. BC uses the live scene's authoritative actor positions, field scale and model bounds for native-arena framing, plus a bounded private Secondary View with the matching environment and its own independent camera.

**Private-view weather is intentionally omitted.** Importer 0.14.4 can advance weather state during ordinary scene rendering; BC does not create or step a second weather simulation for PiP. The main view keeps Importer's weather normally. The PiP keeps the real environment, live actor and BC framing without weather.

The native-arena correction remains separate from Kenney/classic framing. It does not globally retune every Importer world. On Gen 2, Phenac admits the live selected `environment` mode or confirmed native `arena` mode; `classic` retains its existing admission rules.

Direct **0.14.2** and **0.14.0** retain their prior direct validation. Older hosted and LIVE VOXEL ARENA combinations retain their own exact version pins. New provider support is additive: older working setups do not acquire a dependency on 0.14.4-only functions. No claim is made that every field is collision-free under every authored shot.

> [!WARNING]
> **Gen 2 Importer + separate Colosseum UI:** the white/native battle overlay conflict was reproduced on Importer **0.14.0** with BC disabled. That mixed UI stack has not been recertified on 0.14.4, and this release does not claim a fix. Direct BC + Importer is a separate validated path.

**Performance:** PiP adds rendering work and its cost varies by device and scene. This compatibility release does not claim a general frame-rate improvement.

### Gen 2 hosted presentation

> [!NOTE]
> **Battle Art Voxel Gen2 + [Stadium 2 Importer](https://github.com/Deftones565/gen1recomp-mod-stadium2-importer):** use Battle Art `ARENA FILL = OFF` and `STADIUM CIRCLE = OFF` for the validated hosted composition. Importer `MODELS` must be in the desired state when BC initializes. MODELS ON attaches the live Stadium Gen2 backend; MODELS OFF uses Battle Art Gen2's fixed-FRONT vanilla Secondary View. Switching between them requires a reload before BC can discover the other backend.

> [!NOTE]
> **[PotatoVoxel](https://github.com/ShaneMcGovernIE/potato_voxel) Gen 2 standalone:** [PotatoVoxel](https://github.com/ShaneMcGovernIE/potato_voxel) 1.9.6 does not currently establish its own standalone Gen 2 voxel battle presentation under the tested Recomp environment. BC therefore has no Potato-native Gen 2 voxel arena to override into. This is a provider/runtime boundary, not a BC camera failure.

> [!NOTE]
> **[Stadium2 Overworld Models](https://github.com/randyadr/Gen2-3D-Sprites):** the earlier v1.4.3 performance warning is historical, not a current blanket rejection of `0.4.33`. v1.4.4 subsequently validated the modern Gen 2 live-world/PiP route, including weather, private-UI exclusion and touch/mouse placement, with acceptable reported performance. `0.2.81` retains its older path. This does not certify every setting/device or the provider's integrated StadiumBattleFX.

### Gen 1 LIVE VOXEL ARENA providers for Stadium 2 Importer

- **[Dramaless Shape](https://github.com/artyrambles/DRAMALESS_SHAPE) 2.0.4**
- **[Official Dramatic Shape](https://github.com/DramaticShape/DramaticShapeVoxelMod) 1.6.1 — Gen 1 MAP / A**
- **[Voxel Ascendant](https://github.com/Roxas2712/voxel-ascendant) 2.0.2 — MAP**
- **[PotatoVoxel](https://github.com/ShaneMcGovernIE/potato_voxel) 1.9.6 — MAP / 2D-3D A**

**[Battle Art Voxel Fork](https://github.com/absol89/DramaticShapeVoxelMod) 1.10.8** supplies its environment through its own established integration rather than BC's arena-override bridge. The current Legendary visual stack is validated on this direct Gen 1 Battle Art path.

### StadiumBattleFX + voxel providers

[StadiumBattleFX](https://github.com/anxiousintrovert/StadiumBattleFX) can provide a separate Gen1 Stadium-model presentation while compatible voxel backends continue to provide the battle environment. This is provider-specific and should not be assumed to work identically across every backend.

| Voxel provider | SBFX Stadium model state v2.1.8.1|
|---|---|
| **[Dramaless Shape](https://github.com/artyrambles/DRAMALESS_SHAPE) 2.0.3** | ✅ **Validated.** Select its registered voxel arena in SBFX `BATTLE ARENA`. Stadium models + voxel world + BC cameras + Secondary View work correctly. |


Dramatic Shape support targets the official MIT 1.6.1 archive (manifest 1.6.1; its older compatibility export still reads 1.5.5). Later derived builds are not active recommendations here. The 1.6.1 bridge is **Gen 1 only**; its separate PiP stale-environment report is not claimed fixed by the main-world performance improvement.

## Colosseum Battle Environments / Colosseum Overhaul — Gen 1 and Gen 2

**Retained standalone/combined-package matrix.** These are the earlier original-host CBE integrations, not the new integrated Terrarium Advanced route. v1.5 does not promote these rows to Terrarium singles/doubles/Boss parity.

| Exact provider | Status | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| **[CBE](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Battle-Environments-1.0-BETA) 1.8.4** (`1.8.4-capture-member-hsd.1`) | Retained runtime-validated support | Legacy exact-stock adapter. Keep **COLOSSEUM CAMERA OFF**. Primary cameras, battle/Pokémon intros, manual control and bounded portable-actor PiP retained; Gen 1 PiP reactions can be less consistent than Gen 2. |
| **[CBE](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Battle-Environments-1.0-BETA) 2.0** | Prior main-camera support retained on Gen 1 and Gen 2 | New live-arena PiP and inward Phenac adapter included; new runtime proof is the shared combined Overhaul 1.0 / Gen2 route, not a fresh standalone run. Existing phase ownership, portable actor, Attack timing, manual controls and doubles policy remain. |
| **[Colosseum Overhaul](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Inspired-UI-Overhaul-V.1.0.0) 1.0** | **Runtime-validated on Gen 1 and Gen 2** | Exact combined [CBE](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Battle-Environments-1.0-BETA) 2.0 + Colosseum UI package. BC recognises the combined manifest directly and supplies the same accepted [CBE](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Battle-Environments-1.0-BETA) 2.0 camera/PiP integration without modifying its bundled UI or imported cache. |

Install one of the exact supported packages. No custom companion, external patch application or separate compatibility mod is required. BC reads and checks the supported provider source during normal load and supplies the camera integration in memory. It does **not** rewrite installed provider files, the imported disc or the generated cache. Unknown provider bytes are left to load normally without a speculative adapter; later provider updates are not automatically certified.

### Validated CBE 2.0 / Colosseum Overhaul configuration

**Recorded setup:** [Gen1Recomp](https://github.com/bryanthaboi/gen1recomp) **0.2.54 / Gen 2**, [Colosseum Overhaul](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Inspired-UI-Overhaul-V.1.0.0) **1.0**, and **Battle Art Voxel Gen2** (version not restated). Set **COLOSSEUM BATTLE CAMERA OFF**. **AUTO BATTLE FLOW can remain enabled** in this tested setup; the older blanket OFF instruction is superseded. This is a settings-record correction, not a new battle-flow arbitration change.

```text
BC CAMERA AUTHORITY       BC PRIORITY
COLOSSEUM ARENAS           ON
COLOSSEUM BATTLE CAMERA    OFF (recorded showcase setup)
AUTO BATTLE FLOW           may remain enabled
```

Enable **SECOND VIEW PIP** for the new background; keep **320×180** as the baseline render resolution. Enable **BATTLE INTRO → PHENAC STADIUM** for the encounter categories where you want the full opening. Pokémon Intro is a separate option.

Earlier **BC PRIORITY** camera-ON/OFF validation for these exact current packages is retained, not removed by the camera-OFF showcase recipe. BC does not rewrite the provider's saved preferences. This release does not newly validate Boss Intro co-running with Phenac or change the actual-doubles boundary.



Camera ownership remains phase-scoped:

| BC selection | [CBE](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Battle-Environments-1.0-BETA) 2.0 / Overhaul behaviour |
|---|---|
| **BC PRIORITY** | BC directs the enabled shot while it owns that phase, whether the regular [CBE](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Battle-Environments-1.0-BETA) camera is ON or OFF. |
| **IDLE PRESET → EXTERNAL** | Native idle camera; enabled BC Pokémon Intro, Attack and Faint cameras can still take their own phases. |
| **An individual BC event camera OFF** | The released event is available to [CBE](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Battle-Environments-1.0-BETA) unless another active BC module owns the frame. |
| **COOPERATIVE + [CBE](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Battle-Environments-1.0-BETA) CAMERA ON** | Native [CBE](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Battle-Environments-1.0-BETA) main camera; enabled BC PiP remains available under its normal startup and visibility rules. |
| **BC DISABLED** | BC yields the main camera and disables its PiP. |
| **Actual [CBE](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Battle-Environments-1.0-BETA) doubles session** | [CBE](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Battle-Environments-1.0-BETA) owns its doubles presentation and camera. BC does not run Phenac over an admitted doubles battle. |

Unclaimed windows retain the provider's behaviour. With COOPERATIVE and [CBE](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Battle-Environments-1.0-BETA) CAMERA OFF, BC retains the established camera-OFF path rather than forcing a native camera that the user disabled.

**DOUBLE BATTLES is permission, not global camera ownership.** It may stay ON: ordinary single encounters can still use BC and Phenac, while an encounter actually admitted into [CBE](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Battle-Environments-1.0-BETA)'s doubles runtime is handed to [CBE](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Battle-Environments-1.0-BETA).

**Phenac flow note:** the tested combined setup no longer carries a blanket **AUTO BATTLE FLOW OFF** requirement. The separate **BOSS INTRO** co-running limitation and existing conflict-notice behavior are not changed or newly certified here. Follow the current recorded setup above; BC does not modify provider options.

Other BC cameras remain usable without Phenac under their normal ownership rules.
### CBE Secondary View

For the exact [Colosseum Battle Environments](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Battle-Environments-1.0-BETA) **2.0** and [Colosseum Overhaul](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Inspired-UI-Overhaul-V.1.0.0) **1.0** packages, Secondary View now draws **the selected arena's resident geometry, materials and background** around the established private portable player. The camera keeps BC's independent APB-aware portrait framing and mild pan; it does not copy the main camera or chase animation displacement.

The arena is borrowed read-only into a bounded second target, **320×180 by default**. BC does not advance the arena twice, draw the main battle twice or rebuild the imported cache. This adds real environment depth; it is not a claim that trainers, every battle effect or a complete second battle simulation are newly mirrored.

**Runtime proof:** Orre Colosseum and Outskirts on the recorded Gen2 / combined Overhaul 1.0 setup. The shared renderer was also exercised across the catalogue in isolated source checks, which are not device tests of every venue. Real foreground props can still obscure a private angle; this is not an all-arena occlusion fix.

The older **CBE 1.8.4** path keeps its original themed backdrop. On the new 2.0/1.0 path, an unavailable or mismatched resident-arena interface withholds the frame rather than painting a guessed stage or retaining another arena's image. AUTO/RANDOM remain provider selectors, not extra stages.

Real arena rendering costs more than the previous themed card. Increasing PiP resolution changes sampling workload, not subject scale. Start at the default before increasing quality on a heavier scene.

[Full-sound Orre and Outskirts showcases](https://github.com/EnterPlayerOne/Battle-Cinematics-Stadium-Camera/releases/tag/v1.4.2) show the accepted behavior. The recordings include **Stadium Announcer 2.0.0**; its delayed opponent-name call at Phenac HOLD is **not fixed in this release**.

Updating **BC only** does not require clearing data, reinstalling Recomp or rebuilding imported assets. Keep your working provider archives and cache.

# Using Battle Cinematics

The sections below follow the in-game Battle Cinematics menu. New permanent features should be added to this sequence; version-specific history belongs in GitHub Releases instead of being appended to the README.

---

## Menu navigation

The main configurable rows display their current selection and end in `...`:

```text
IDLE PRESET...
PKMN INTRO CAM...
BATTLE INTRO...
SECOND VIEW PIP...
```

Left/right changes the main value; A opens that feature's child page, whose first row repeats its principal selector. B returns to the previous root cursor/scroll position. The game's ManagerState and any compatible custom skin still own drawing, navigation and persistence. Separate CONFIGURE rows are no longer needed.

## Optional Battle Intro — Phenac Stadium

**Voxel / Dramatic Shape 1.6.1 + Colosseum UI**

![Phenac Stadium — Voxel / Dramatic Shape](media/Phenac_Stadium_Voxel_Full_README.gif)

**Colosseum Battle Environments + Colosseum UI**

![Phenac Stadium — Colosseum Battle Environments](media/Phenac_Stadium_CBE_Full_README.gif)

`BATTLE INTRO...` is an **OFF / ON** master. The child page assigns **PHENAC STADIUM / OFF** independently to Wild, ordinary Trainer, Gym Leaders, Elite Four, Champion and Rival battles. There is no duplicate ALL BATTLES row. Gym applies to leaders, not every gym trainer. Champion and Rival are distinct even when the same character fills both roles. Generation-specific battle metadata is used; the classifications are not a blanket runtime certification of every encounter.

During the moving opening, A cannot advance the encounter underneath it. **B** skips the camera to its authored final hold without advancing the game. At that hold, A resumes normal encounter flow. The small **B SKIP** prompt is shown only while a B-skip is available.

Trainer battles continue from the trainer hold through enemy send-out/Intro and player send-out/Intro. A wild opening replaces the initial enemy Pokémon Intro and continues to the actual player throw/send-out, then player Intro. Ordinary Pokémon Intros retain their own cancel setting.

v1.4.3 retains the **13.2-second** Phenac sequence and makes the shorter physical opening a shared standard on already-admitted Phenac paths. The exact [Colosseum Battle Environments](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Battle-Environments-1.0-BETA) 2.0 / [Colosseum Overhaul](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Inspired-UI-Overhaul-V.1.0.0) native envelope remains authoritative there; other admitted paths use the same smooth inward-compression method in their own shot space. The opening rejoins the original path at **4.05 seconds**. Focus choreography, later travel, final HOLD and A/B handoff are unchanged. Geometry passthrough can still occur in some venues; this is not universal mesh collision avoidance.

The validated direct Importer **0.14.4** selected environment/native-arena stages remain admitted on Gen2, including provider-selected cave stages. Direct 0.14.2/0.14.0 support is retained. Non-stage live-world interiors and unknown map contexts keep their existing safeguards; no voxel translation lock is added.

**Recorded setup:** [Gen1Recomp](https://github.com/bryanthaboi/gen1recomp) **0.2.54 / Gen 2**, [Colosseum Overhaul](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Inspired-UI-Overhaul-V.1.0.0) **1.0**, and **Battle Art Voxel Gen2** (version not restated). Set **COLOSSEUM BATTLE CAMERA OFF**. **AUTO BATTLE FLOW can remain enabled** in this tested setup; the older blanket OFF instruction is superseded. This is a settings-record correction, not a new battle-flow arbitration change. **BOSS INTRO** co-running is not newly validated; actual admitted doubles remain provider-owned. The existing conflict notice does not pause play, capture input or rewrite settings. **Stadium Announcer 2.0.0** can still delay an opponent-name call until A releases the Phenac HOLD; that timing enhancement remains separate.

## 1. Camera Authority

`CAMERA AUTHORITY` is the top-level BC ownership control.

- **BC PRIORITY — default:** BC owns the camera phases you have enabled.
- **COOPERATIVE:** allows compatible presentation systems more room to participate where supported.
- **BC DISABLED:** leaves BC installed but stops BC camera ownership.

Ownership is **phase-scoped**, not battle-wide. A host can own the idle camera through External while BC still owns Pokémon Intro, Attack or Faint.

With **CBE 2.0**, BC PRIORITY overrides the enabled native camera only for BC-owned phases. COOPERATIVE with CBE CAMERA ON returns the main camera to CBE without disabling an otherwise eligible PiP. BC DISABLED also disables PiP. The CBE configuration and legacy-version distinction are documented above.

---

## 2. 4-Way Sprite View


![4-Way Sprite View](media/Battle_Cinematics_4-Way_Sprite_View_V2.gif)


A separate vanilla / ROM-sprite example shows the same camera-relative presentation on the flat-card path:


![Vanilla 4-Way Sprite View](media/Battle_Cinematics_Vanilla_4-Way_Sprite_View_V2.gif)

**4-WAY SPRITE VIEW** makes supported flat-card Pokémon behave like world-facing actors instead of cards permanently locked to one battle-screen direction.

BC can independently resolve each battler's normal **FRONT / BACK** representation and then orient it **LEFT / RIGHT** toward the fight as the final camera moves.

This creates a practical four-way presentation without requiring four separate sprite assets.

- **DYNAMIC — default:** full camera-aware four-way behavior. BC selects FRONT/BACK per battler and applies LEFT/RIGHT facing.
- **TURN ONLY:** keep the host/provider's FRONT/BACK choice and apply only horizontal turning.
- **HOST DEFAULT:** zero-touch host presentation.

Genuine 3D Pokémon models automatically yield from this system.

### Animated sprite presentations

![Gen 5 Animated](media/Battle_Cinematics_Gen5_Animated_Showcase_V2b.gif)

![Crystal Animated](media/Battle_Cinematics_Crystal_Animated_Showcase_V2b.gif)

BC does not replace animated sprite providers. The provider keeps the artwork, animation, scale and lifecycle; BC supplies the camera-relative presentation layer where that host exposes a compatible path.

---

## 3. Idle Preset

**Terrarium Advanced:** these same authored idle presets are adapted to staged singles and real four-slot doubles. They resume after the provider-owned combat/send-in chapter finishes. A separate retail Colosseum floor/owner idle scheduler is not a selectable new preset in v1.5.

The idle preset controls BC's passive camera while you are navigating the battle and no higher-priority cinematic phase is active.

### Stadium 64 — default

![Stadium full camera cycle](media/stadium-mewtwo-full-cycle.gif)

BC's source-faithful translation of the original **Pokémon Stadium** passive battle-camera language: wide establishing shots, player/opponent portraits, sweeping battlefield movement and rising horseshoe-style rotations.

The Stadium choreography was captured from the original game and translated into relative compositions rather than blindly replaying N64 world coordinates. That lets BC preserve the visual language while adapting it to Recomp's actual battle environment.

### DW3 Classic

The original Battle Cinematics camera language. DW3 is more intimate and interpretive, with orbital movement, shoulder compositions and close environmental framing.

### Hero Portrait

A calmer passive style that keeps the Pokémon visually dominant with less physical camera travel.

### External

`EXTERNAL` yields the passive / idle camera to the active compatible host.

> **EXTERNAL CAMERA — HOST OWNED**  
> **BC PHASE MODULES — STILL INDEPENDENT**

Pokémon Intro, Attack Camera, Faint Camera and Secondary View can remain independently enabled.

### Idle Preset settings

Stadium 64, DW3 Classic and Hero Portrait each expose contextual tuning without cluttering the main menu:

- Framing: Extra Wide / Wide / Standard / Near / Close
- Orbit Speed: Slowest / Slow / Medium / Fast
- Height: Low / Standard / High
- Angle: Shallow / Standard / Strong

---

## 4. Idle View

`IDLE VIEW` is a renderer-neutral optical modifier for ordinary BC passive/menu cameras.

- Standard — default
- Wide
- Extra Wide
- Ultra Wide

It changes the viewing width without rewriting the authored physical camera path.

---

## 5. Initial Delay

Controls how long BC waits before beginning passive cinematography after a usable battle camera is established.

- Immediate
- **2 Seconds — default**
- 4 Seconds
- 6 Seconds
- 9 Seconds
- 12 Seconds
- 15 Seconds

Intro / Attack / Faint remain their own battle-aware phases; this delay is for passive cinematography.

---

## 6. Pokémon Intro — BC Hero

**Terrarium Advanced Colosseum routes:** the BC HERO option admits the accepted real trainer throw/follow-through → source-derived resident Pokémon reveal, including replacements and player sends where the provider supplies them. Manual first-enemy trainer-battle reveals retain A CONTINUE / B SKIP; AUTO BATTLE FLOW avoids this manual gate. The historical FULL/COMPACT description below remains the ordinary BC Hero route, not a command to replace the provider's source send-in.

<!-- SHOWCASE: Stadium2Importer Stadium.mp4 opening / strongest existing BC Hero clips -->

![Pokémon Intro — Stadium 2 Importer / Gold](media/Battle_Cinematics_Pokemon_Intro_Stadium2_Importer_Gold.gif)


BC Hero gives newly presented Pokémon a dedicated cinematic send-in before handing cleanly into the passive battle camera.

The lifecycle understands the battle rather than replaying one intro blindly:

- opening Pokémon → **FULL**;
- enemy replacement → **FULL**;
- forced player replacement after faint → **FULL**;
- later voluntary switch against an established opponent → **COMPACT**;
- battle progression / move commitment immediately wins if the game moves on.

### Configure Intro Cam

- Framing: Extra Wide / Wide / Near / Close
- Speed: Slow / Normal / Fast / Faster
- Hero Tilt: Off / On
- Cancel: B Button / Any Input / On Move/Item / Off
- Reset to Default

Current intended baseline is **WIDE** framing with **Hero Tilt OFF**.

---

<a id="7-stadium-attack-camera"></a>

## 7. Attack Camera — AUTO / STADIUM

![Attack and Faint example](media/articuno-attack-faint.gif)

The **ATTACK CAMERA → AUTO / STADIUM** selection follows the supported host presentation. On positively identified Terrarium/CBE Colosseum routes it selects the Colosseum treatment automatically; on ordinary supported hosts it retains Stadium. Explicit **COLOSSEUM** remains available, and **OFF** remains OFF. Selecting another provider does not rewrite the saved choice.

On exact Terrarium Advanced 1.7.4 staged singles, BC preserves the already-resolved provider combat pose during source attack, damage and reaction chapters. It does not run a second Camera update, replay the move, or impose a new attack timer. Doubles retains its accepted source-derived owner/recipient camera route. The provider still owns action/FX/audio and battle progression.

BC can reason about semantic move roles such as attacker declaration, travel/tracking, recipient/impact, SELF actions, FIELD-style actions and different animation windows. Camera timing follows the real battle presentation and remains compatible with accelerated game speed.

The Attack Camera is independent of the selected idle preset.

For **CBE 2.0 native Colosseum Pokémon models**, BC uses the resident model and source-effect presentation clocks rather than a fixed two-second fallback. Longer moves retain their camera sequence through sustained effects and surviving particle tails. This is not a blanket slowdown: the authored path and APB composition stay the same, while the provider supplies the action timing. Faint handoff follows the visible model-collapse boundary rather than an early HP/KO message. Other providers and CBE's non-native presentation routes keep their established timing paths.

---

## 8. Faint Camera

`FAINT CAMERA → ON` gives the defeated Pokémon a dedicated final presentation. On supported Terrarium Advanced staged singles, this preserves the provider's native source faint camera and intended handoff rather than substituting a generic wide final shot. The native actor may finish collapsing/disappearing; BC does not keep it alive or change the provider's removal clock.

It remains phase-scoped and renderer-independent. On provider-owned Gen 2 presentations, BC follows the real visible faint lifecycle rather than artificially keeping an actor alive after the host removes it.

---


## 9. Secondary View PiP

![Continuous Secondary View](media/Battle_Cinematics_Continuous_Secondary_View_Showcase_INLINE.gif)

Secondary View is an optional **independent second camera**. It is not a crop of the main view.

`SECOND VIEW PIP` defaults **OFF** so updating BC never silently adds another rendered view.

**Terrarium Advanced doubles:** PiP is intentionally unavailable during an actual doubles battle, with a compatibility notice. Your saved PiP setting is preserved. Supported singles, including the tested explicit CBE OVERWORLD route, retain their bounded independent view.

When enabled, `SECOND VIEW PIP... (A opens settings)` provides:

### PIP MODE

- **LIVE VIEW — default:** persistent alternate view of the same active battle presentation. Where the host exposes a safe live presentation seam, BC redraws that state through its second camera rather than running a separate imitation battle timeline.
- **LIVING PORTRAIT:** persistent independently animated character portrait. This intentionally keeps its own expressive presentation rather than mirroring the main battle frame-for-frame.
- **DYNAMIC (DW3):** the original authored Secondary View behavior, appearing only during its intended cinematic battle phases.

Persistent **LIVE VIEW** and **LIVING PORTRAIT** begin as soon as the opening player Pokémon Intro / send-out presentation has genuinely cleared. They do **not** wait for the main passive camera's `INITIAL DELAY`.

LIVE VIEW follows the battle state actually exposed by the active provider: idle presentation, move-specific attack animation, fainting, vacancy and replacement where supported.

> **One battle state → two cameras → two views.**

BC does not invent provider presentation that does not exist. If a host does not implement a particular reaction or animation state, Secondary View does not fabricate one.

### PiP Render Resolution

`PIP RENDER RESOLUTION` controls the internal quality of the Secondary View independently from its physical on-screen size.

- 160x90
- 240x135
- **320x180 — default**
- 480x270
- 640x360
- 960x540
- 1280x720

Higher resolutions are intentionally available for stronger phones, handhelds and PCs.

`PIP SIZE` remains purely the physical compositor/window size.

>320x180 is the recommended default. Higher resolutions increase private-render workload and may have a noticeable performance cost on heavier backends or densely populated scenes.

### Frame Style and PiP Border

`FRAME STYLE` and `PIP BORDER` are independent **global PiP options**, not CBE-only controls.

| Control | Choices | New-configuration default |
|---|---|---|
| **FRAME STYLE** | **ROUNDED** / **COLOSSEUM** | **COLOSSEUM** |
| **PIP BORDER** | **WHITE** / **DARK** / **COLOSSEUM GREY** | **COLOSSEUM GREY** |

ROUNDED is the original frame. COLOSSEUM cuts all four corners, including the picture itself, to match the Colosseum-style portrait surrounds without zooming or recentering the Pokémon. COLOSSEUM GREY matches the reference portrait metal face/lip colour: normalized RGB **0.30, 0.32, 0.30**. Shape and colour can be mixed freely; neither changes framing, placement or render resolution, and no additional world render is required.

Existing BC configurations keep their previous colour and receive ROUNDED when no style was previously selected. Explicit new choices are retained. A PiP **RESET TO DEFAULT** deliberately selects the new Colosseum style/grey defaults without turning PiP itself on. The matching UI mod is not required and no UI assets are bundled.

### PiP View

- Size: Standard / **Small — default**
- Framing: **Normal — default** / Close
- Side: **Left (DW3) — default** / Right
- Place: Mid Center / Top Right / **Mid Right — default** / Top Left / Mid Left / Custom

↖️ **Desktop:** left-click inside the visible PiP, drag it to a new position, then release to save **CUSTOM** placement. BC captures that gesture even when the presentation provider normally uses the mouse to steer its battle camera. Mouse camera handling outside the PiP is left alone and resumes after release. Existing touch placement is unchanged.

Different hosts expose different safe private-render seams. BC adapts to those provider boundaries while preserving the same public Secondary View behavior: the provider owns its world, artwork, models and animation state; BC owns the alternate camera and render target.

### Upgrade behavior

The **v1.2.5** PIP MODE migration introduced **LIVE VIEW** as the default.

Existing installations are migrated to LIVE VIEW **once** when first upgrading to that PIP MODE system. After that migration, the user's own choice is respected normally: LIVE VIEW, LIVING PORTRAIT or DYNAMIC (DW3) all persist across restart. v1.4.3 does not reapply a completed mode migration.

The separate v1.2.8 frame migration distinguishes a new configuration from an existing one. It preserves existing frame/colour preferences as described above; updating does not switch an existing white or dark frame to grey.

### Performance rule

> **PiP size on screen must not dictate the internal world-render workload.**

Secondary View uses an independent render-resolution setting and backend-appropriate private rendering. Some providers require bounded or aspect-preserving targets and conservative draw scheduling; BC keeps those implementation details provider-specific rather than forcing every renderer through one identical private-scene path.


---

## 10. Battle Arena Override


![Battle Arena Override — Live Voxel Arena](media/Battle_Cinematics_Live_Voxel_Arena_Override_Showcase_INLINE.gif)


`BATTLE ARENA OVERRIDE` controls **environment ownership** for compatible Stadium 2 Importer compositions where an independent live voxel/world provider is actually available.

- **LIVE VOXEL ARENA — default:** use a compatible live voxel/world provider as the battle environment while Stadium 2 Importer keeps its genuine Stadium actors, animation and HUD.
- **HOST DEFAULT:** leave the environment entirely to Stadium 2 Importer.

This setting changes the **arena only**. It does not enable Stadium models, manufacture a missing 3D provider path or turn a 2D battle into a 3D battle.

If no compatible live voxel battle world exists for the active generation/provider stack, **LIVE VOXEL ARENA** safely has nothing to substitute and the working host presentation remains in control.

The intended division of responsibility is simple:

> **Voxel provider → world / arena**  
> **Stadium 2 Importer → Stadium models / animation / HUD**  
> **Battle Cinematics → camera direction / Secondary View**

Supported BC-managed LIVE VOXEL ARENA providers are listed in the compatibility tables above.

For example, **PotatoVoxel 1.9.6 + Stadium 2 Importer 0.12.1** is a valid Gen 2 combination, but the battle remains in Stadium 2 Importer's circular arena because Potato does not currently expose an attached Gen 2 voxel battle world for BC to substitute.

---

## 11. Legacy Options

`RESET CAMERA` retains older input-driven escape-hatch behavior:

- **Off — default**
- Confirmed Action
- Any Input

Most users should leave this Off. BC's current battle-aware phase lifecycle normally handles camera transitions without needing generic input cancellation.

---

## 12. Diagnostics / Reset

Diagnostics are intended for compatibility testing and support, not normal play. Keep them **OFF** unless you are deliberately gathering evidence for a problem.

Reset Defaults restores the current BC defaults for the relevant configuration.

---

# Presentation-aware framing — APB

![Pidgeotto APB origin](media/pidgeotto-apb-origin.gif)

**Adaptive Presentation Bounds (APB)** is BC's renderer-neutral language for understanding the Pokémon currently being presented.

Instead of assuming every actor occupies the same volume, compatible adapters can describe facts such as visible top/bottom, visual centre, presented height, elevation and breadth. Each authored camera shot then decides how much of that information it should consume.

> **APB understands the whole presented actor; the authored shot decides how much of that actor it wants to show.**

That distinction matters: Onix can be tall and grounded, Pidgeotto can be genuinely elevated, Articuno can be broad, Snorlax can be bulky, and a classic fixed-card sprite may already fit perfectly without needing dramatic correction.

![Snorlax breadth](media/snorlax-breadth.gif)

![Mew presentation-aware framing](media/mew-presentation-aware.gif)

No Pokémon species, type or model-name camera hardcodes are required for those decisions.

---

# Camera safety without camera sameness

Recomp battle environments are not empty Stadium arenas. Routes, caves, forests and towns contain boundaries, walls, trees, ledges, rocks, façades, roofs and renderer-specific dead zones.

BC-authored camera paths use shared protection systems that can:

- keep the camera inside valid map space;
- prevent physical traversal through known structural geometry;
- protect narrow routes and 3D → 2D presentation boundaries;
- recover from sustained subject obstruction;
- reason about building body / façade / roof structure where reliable evidence exists;
- substitute an impossible physical route while preserving the intended cinematic composition.

Source-first Terrarium combat poses remain provider-owned and retain the provider's own framing/safety behaviour; BC does not newly run them through a second synthetic camera solve. This release is not a collision-free guarantee for every arena or map.

Safety is infrastructure, **not** a replacement aesthetic.

A tree crossing the foreground can be good cinematography. A camera physically travelling through that tree is not.

![Celadon structural safety](media/Celadon1.0.gif)

![Power Plant structural safety](media/Plant%20(1).gif)

![Open-route Stadium camera](media/Cerulean%201.0.0_1%20(1)%20(1)%20(3).gif)

BC deliberately preserves useful foreground grazing and environmental depth wherever the subject remains readable.

---

# Manual camera ownership

## Gen 1 / RBY

BC owns the established manual-camera contract:

> **grab current BC shot → free orbit / look → release → soft return to authored BC camera**

4-Way Sprite View follows the final camera, so supported flat-card actors remain spatially coherent while the user moves around the battle.

The exact **Dramaless + Stadium 2 Importer** composition intentionally uses the provider's bounded native manual behavior rather than unrestricted BC free orbit, because that host combination has its own safe camera envelope.

## Gen 2 / Gold, Silver, Crystal

The active compatible provider normally owns the right stick. **CBE is an explicit exception:** BC supplies its existing manual orbit in both generations when BC directs the CBE camera. Other Gen 2 providers keep their manual control and are not globally overridden.

![Stadium2 Overworld Models first-person provider control](media/randy-first-provider-control.gif)

![Stadium2 Overworld Models third-person provider control](media/randy-third-provider-control.gif)

Voxel Ultimate and `STADIUM2_OVERWORLD_MODELS` keep their provider-native manual-camera semantics while BC retains its configured camera phases.

---

# Quick setup guidance

### I want the new Terrarium Advanced Colosseum presentation

Use Terrarium Advanced **1.7.4** on the tested Gen2Recomped path, then **BC PRIORITY + AUTO / STADIUM + Faint ON**. Keep the provider's working imports and settings. Choose Stadium/DW3/Hero idle independently; enable Phenac and singles PiP separately. Real doubles shows the expected PiP compatibility notice. See [Terrarium Advanced setup](#terrarium-advanced-174-setup) for the host/cartridge limits.

### I want BC direction in Colosseum Battle Environments

Use the exact supported [Colosseum Battle Environments](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Battle-Environments-1.0-BETA) **2.0** or [Colosseum Overhaul](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Inspired-UI-Overhaul-V.1.0.0) **1.0** combined package with **CAMERA AUTHORITY → BC PRIORITY**. For the recorded Gen2 / combined setup, set **COLOSSEUM BATTLE CAMERA OFF**; **AUTO BATTLE FLOW may remain enabled**. Enable PiP and, separately, Phenac as desired. Actual admitted doubles remain CBE-owned. Battle Intro and PiP default OFF. No extra compatibility mod or asset reimport is required. See the CBE configuration section for the retained camera-ON/OFF and Boss Intro boundaries.

### I want BC cinematography with sprites

Use a supported live battle/world host and leave **4-WAY SPRITE VIEW → DYNAMIC**. Stadium models are not required.

### I want genuine Stadium models

Use **Stadium 2 Importer 0.14.4** for the current validated direct Gen 1 or Gen 2 Stadium presentation. BC directs the enabled Stadium 64 / DW3 / Hero, Pokémon Intro, Attack, Faint and Secondary View phases while Importer owns the models, animation and selected environment. **Kenney/custom environments and native/test arenas** retain the established BC presentation on the tested updated paths; Phenac also runs on admitted provider-selected stages. Direct 0.14.2 and 0.14.0 remain supported rather than being replaced.

For the older Battle Art Gen2 hosted composition, keep the separately validated **Stadium 2 Importer 0.12.1** setup described in the compatibility table; v1.4.3 does not silently certify that mixed stack on newer Importer releases.

### I want Stadium models in the actual voxel world

On a supported Gen 1 composition, set:

`BATTLE ARENA OVERRIDE → LIVE VOXEL ARENA`

The voxel provider supplies the environment, Stadium 2 Importer supplies the actors/HUD, and BC directs the camera.

### I want the host's idle camera but BC's battle cinematics

Set:

`IDLE PRESET → EXTERNAL`

Then leave Pokémon Intro / Attack / Faint enabled as desired.

> **Using StadiumBattleFX models?**  
> **Dramaless Shape 2.0.3** is the currently validated voxel-world companion. In SBFX, set `BATTLE ARENA` to the registered **VOXEL ARENA** entry for Dramaless, then let Battle Cinematics handle camera direction.

---

# Troubleshooting

### Terrarium doubles shows a PiP compatibility notice

That is intentional, not a failed import. v1.5 retains the saved PiP setting but does not render PiP during real doubles. Supported singles can still use it.

### AUTO / STADIUM is selected instead of COLOSSEUM

That is the intended plug-and-play setting. A recognised Colosseum route receives the Colosseum treatment automatically. Confirm the correct provider/route is active rather than resetting settings or manually changing modes on every battle.

### CBE is still using its own main camera

On the exact supported [Colosseum Battle Environments](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Battle-Environments-1.0-BETA) **2.0** / [Colosseum Overhaul](https://github.com/HighDrexler/Colosseum-Inspired-UI-Overhaul-V.1.0.0) **1.0** packages, check **CAMERA AUTHORITY → BC PRIORITY** and enable the desired BC phase. EXTERNAL releases idle; COOPERATIVE with the provider camera ON releases the main view; BC DISABLED yields completely. For the recorded Gen2 / combined setup use **COLOSSEUM BATTLE CAMERA OFF**, without imposing the old blanket Auto Battle Flow OFF instruction. Actual admitted doubles remain provider-owned; Boss Intro co-running is not newly validated. The older CBE 1.8.4 path still requires CAMERA OFF, and unknown source versions may not match the adapter.

### PiP still has its old rounded frame after updating

That is deliberate preference preservation. Open **SECOND VIEW PIP...**, select **FRAME STYLE → COLOSSEUM**, then **PIP BORDER → COLOSSEUM GREY**. There is no need to reset all settings or install a different UI.

### My Pokémon looks camera-locked or faces the wrong way

First check **4-WAY SPRITE VIEW → DYNAMIC** on a supported flat-card path. Older advice to force particular back/front settings is not the general BC model anymore; validated Dynamic adapters should normally own the camera-relative choice themselves.

If you deliberately choose HOST DEFAULT, the host's own fixed presentation may naturally look less spatially convincing during large camera movements.

### A provider says it supports 3D, but BC only sees 2D

Test the provider **without BC first**. BC can adapt a working presentation path; it does not manufacture a provider's missing 3D battle scene.

### Gen 2 right stick behaves differently from Gen 1

That is intentional. Gen 1 and BC-directed CBE use BC manual control. Other supported Gen 2 hosts retain provider-owned manual input.

### A camera shot changes in a constrained environment

That can be intentional safety behavior. BC preserves the authored composition where possible and may change the physical route when the environment cannot support it safely.

### Voxel Ultimate behaves strangely with several overlapping presentation mods

Treat Voxel Ultimate as an integrated host. Avoid stacking standalone equivalents of systems it already includes unless the combination is known-good; duplicate provider ownership can create conflicts outside BC's control.
