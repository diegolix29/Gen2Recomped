-- Overworld battles: the over-the-shoulder camera and its parallax drift.
--
-- The two mons are PINNED to their cells: each pic is drawn wherever its
-- patch of ground projects to, not at a fixed screen slot. So the camera is
-- not decoration -- it is the thing that decides where the fight appears,
-- and it has to put those two patches of ground exactly where the battle
-- screen wants its two pics:
--
--     the player's mon   (26, 96)    back pic, feet on the text box, well left
--     the enemy's mon   (124, 56)    front pic, bottom of the 7x7 slot
--
-- Four screen coordinates, so four equations. The rig below is the solution:
-- SIDE / BACK / HEIGHT place the eye relative to the arena's midpoint, LOOK
-- aims it, and FRAME_H sets the lens, and together they land both marks
-- within a thousandth of a pixel of the targets. They are not hand-picked
-- numbers that looked about right -- they came out of a solver, and the
-- suite reprojects them so a future edit either still lands or says so.
--
-- East is what decides which mon is on which side. The arena axis runs north
-- (the enemy) to south (the player's mon), and a camera east of that axis
-- sees the near end swing LEFT and the far end RIGHT -- the layout arrived
-- at by standing in the right place rather than by mirroring anything.
--
-- ------- and two more equations, from the pixels
--
-- The pics are pixel art and their size on screen is not something the mod
-- gets to choose: 56 pixels for a front pic, 64 for a back one. And a mon has
-- to stand in ONE OVERWORLD SQUARE, or it towers over the houses and gives
-- away that the world behind it is a picture. Together those say the square
-- each mon stands on must project to about the width of its own pic, which is
-- two more equations for the same six unknowns -- and they are what set the
-- distance.
--
-- The answer is a LONG LENS FROM A LOW STANCE: twelve degrees above the
-- floor, twelve degrees wide, from five blocks back. Not a stylistic choice
-- -- it is what a 56-pixel sprite standing on a 16-pixel tile forces on a
-- 160-pixel screen. Roughly three tiles fit across the frame, so the camera
-- has to be far away and zoomed in rather than near and wide. That is the
-- DEFAULT rig, and every map that can take it gets it.
--
-- ------- the exception: rooms too small to stand back from
--
-- Five blocks back is further than some rooms are wide. A gym is about ten
-- cells across, so on one the eye lands OUTSIDE the map, where the border
-- ring the engine draws round every map -- extruded into a cliff by this mode
-- -- crosses the near Pokemon wherever it stands. Three gyms could not be
-- staged anywhere at all for that reason.
--
-- So there is a second rig, and an arena asks for it by name (cam = "wide"
-- in data/battle_arenas.lua). It comes in to about four cells with the lens
-- opened up to match: an ordinary 44-degree shot that fits inside the room.
-- The mons render smaller for it -- a bit over half a tile rather than a
-- whole one -- which is the price. Both rigs are solved against the SAME four
-- anchors, so the composition is identical either way; only the lens and the
-- distance differ, which is what makes it safe to pick per map.
--
-- Rooms too small for the long lens are the reason it exists, but it is not
-- only for them: an area that simply reads better with more of itself in
-- shot can ask for it too.
--
-- Purely presentational, like everything else in this mod: the camera looks
-- at the map, and nothing it does reaches collision, movement or scripts.

-- ------- the drift
--
-- A slow orbit about the arena's vertical axis. Rotating about a point
-- BETWEEN the two mons is what makes it parallax rather than a pan: the mons
-- are pinned to the ground, so the near one slides one way across the frame
-- and the far one slides the OTHER, by the amount their difference in
-- distance implies. Over a full swing that is about eight pixels of relative
-- movement -- plainly visible as depth, far too slow to fight the fight.
-- The angle is small because the lens is long: two degrees of orbit is seven
-- pixels of travel through an eleven-degree field of view.
--
-- Under it, a much smaller breath in and out along the same line, on an
-- unrelated period, so the pair never returns to the same pose on any cycle
-- a battle is long enough to show. A DOLLY rather than a pan of the aim:
-- moving the aim point would slide both mons the same way, which with pinned
-- pics is just the whole picture walking sideways. Changing the DISTANCE
-- moves them apart and back together about the frame's centre, which is the
-- same depth cue the orbit gives, from the other axis.

-- ------- the player's own orbit
--
-- The drift above is the shot breathing. THIS is the player steering it:
-- a right stick, a drag across the screen or the mouse walks the eye
-- around the arena's axis, and it stops at both ends.
--
-- 0 is the shot the rig was solved for and the LEFT stop, because there is
-- nothing to the left of it -- the composition below is what the whole
-- module exists to land, and past it the two mons start swapping sides.
--
-- 1 is SIDE-ON: the eye swung round until it is square to the arena's
-- north-south axis, where the two mons stand at the same distance instead
-- of one behind the other. That is as far as the picture stays a battle
-- rather than a diorama with two Pokemon in it, and it is a different angle
-- for each rig -- the tele lens starts 28 degrees off the axis and the wide
-- one 45 -- so the stop is COMPUTED from the rig rather than written down,
-- and retuning either moves its own stop with it.
--
-- The input is deliberately not 1:1 with the pixels: it accumulates into
-- `orbitGoal` and the live angle eases after it, so a flick reads as the
-- camera being pushed rather than as the camera being dragged.

-- ------- and the height it is watched from
--
-- The same steering on the other axis, with the same shape of stop at each
-- end: 0 is the rig's own stance -- the low, near-floor seat the whole
-- composition is solved around, and the DOWN stop, because below it the
-- camera starts looking up the arena's nose -- and 1 is 45 degrees above
-- it, which is high enough to read the ground the fight is standing on
-- without becoming the diorama's own top-down.
--
-- Raised about the FOCUS rather than about the eye, so the aim stays on
-- the two mons and only the seat climbs; and at a constant radius, so
-- climbing never changes how big anything is -- that is the zoom's job.

-- BELOW one is zoomed in. It has to be the LENS rather than the distance,
-- because the rig derives its field of view from frameH and the distance
-- together -- so moving the eye alone changes the perspective and not the
-- framing, which is exactly what the dolly breath above is for.
--
-- Q/E, wheel and pinch remain a fine, session-local adjustment. BTL CAM is
-- the persistent starting distance: changing that row snaps the live goal to
-- exactly 1X/2X/3X once, then lets the direct controls move freely again.
-- Keeping the remembered rung separate from `zoomGoal` is important -- if we

-- The camera for `arena` this instant: the record Voxel3D.camera takes, plus
-- the pitch the pull and the sun frustum want (measured from straight down,
-- the same convention Voxel.angle uses).

-- `fov` here frames the GB's 160x144. A caller rendering at window
-- resolution widens it for the extra picture around that frame -- see
-- BattleScene.letterboxFov, which is what keeps the pins exact at any window
-- size.

-- `groundY` is the height of the arena floor, so a fight staged on a ledge
-- or a raised walkway is shot from above THAT rather than from inside it.
-- `canonical` asks for the shot the rig was SOLVED for -- no drift, no
-- breath, no steer, no zoom -- from a caller that is reasoning about the
-- arena rather than drawing it. BattleArena's clearance test is the one
-- that needs it: whether a fight can be staged somewhere is a fact about
-- the ground, and answering it through whatever angle the player happened
-- to leave the last battle on would pick a different arena depending on
-- where they had swung the camera an hour ago.
