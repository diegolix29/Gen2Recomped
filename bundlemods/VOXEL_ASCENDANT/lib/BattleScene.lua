-- Overworld battles: one frame of the arena, as geometry.
--
-- The same world the free-roam mode draws, from a placed camera instead of
-- the orbit, at the WINDOW's own pixel resolution -- not the GB's. The
-- backdrop reaches the screen through Renderer's worldOverride, the seam a
-- render pipeline's finished world image already composites through, which
-- is drawn one canvas pixel to one screen pixel; the 160x144 battle screen
-- then blits over it in the classic letterbox. So the world is as crisp as
-- the free-roam diorama and the pics, HUDs and text box stay exactly the
-- chunky GB art they are.
--
-- Rendering the whole window rather than just the letterbox means the
-- framing has to be split in two. The RIG frames the GB's 160x144 (see
-- BattleCam, which is solved against coordinates in that frame); this
-- module widens the lens by exactly the ratio the window bears to the
-- letterbox, so the letterbox sub-rectangle of what gets rendered is
-- bit-for-bit the framing the rig asked for, and everything outside it is
-- extra picture. That is what lets the two mons be PINNED: their cells
-- project to the same GB coordinates at any window size or zoom.
--
-- Characters are deliberately absent. The overworld cast is culled for the
-- length of the battle (see OverworldBattle), so this pass has terrain,
-- grass and flowers and nothing that walks -- the arena is empty, which is
-- what makes it an arena.
--
-- Everything expensive is shared with the free-roam mode rather than
-- duplicated: the same chunk meshes out of ChunkMesher, the same palette
-- atlas out of TerrainAtlas, the same sun out of ShadowMap. A battle on a
-- map already meshed for walking around costs the frame it draws and
-- nothing else.

--
-- The billboard texture is the battle screen's own 160x144 pics layer with

-- that whole frame stood up on the map -- which is what carries every pic
-- effect the engine applies without any of them being reimplemented here.
--
-- Its size follows from one number: a full 7x7-tile mon covers one overworld
-- square, so a canvas pixel is FULL_W / FULL_PIC world pixels and the card is
-- the canvas at that scale. Its placement follows from the anchor the
-- texture reports -- the column the pic was centred on and the row its feet
-- were put on -- which is translated onto the cell before the card is stood
-- up, so a mon of any size in any pose has its feet on the ground.
-- `mirror` flips the card about its own anchor column.  The value is resolved
-- from an explicit view/flip receipt below: bundled fronts intrinsically face
-- left, while certified full-body backs intrinsically face right.  This keeps
-- editor preview, native test battle and runtime on the same contract and,
-- crucially, lets a rejected Back -> HD Front fallback change direction too.
-- A companion may return a high-DPI canvas while retaining the logical
-- Gen-1 anchor (80,96).  Never assume that such a card is still 160x144:
-- doing so maps only its upper-left quarter onto the billboard and makes the
-- visible monster half-sized.  Unknown/malformed surfaces retain the native
-- dimensions so an unrelated provider still fails neutral.

-- The MOVE-ANIMATION layer's place in the world: a BILLBOARD facing the

-- renders (the engine's own drawAnimLayer, caught on a canvas).
--
-- Effects are 2D drawings like the pics, and the pics' answer holds for
-- them too: a drawing must FACE the eye that is looking (the mon cards
-- yaw toward it per eye -- see monMatrix). So the frame stands on the
-- arena's midpoint, yawed at the eye like the cards are, and the classic
-- layout's two slot marks are pinned where each CELL lands on that plane
-- along this very eye's own ray -- so from the eye that is looking, a
-- burst authored at a slot sits exactly over the mon standing in for it,
-- and a projectile crossing the frame crosses the arena. The vertical
-- scale is the mon cards' own (FULL_W / FULL_PIC), so an effect is sized
-- like the pics it plays over.
--
-- An eye standing (nearly) ON the arena's axis sees the two cells in
-- line and the pinning degenerates; the frame then falls back to the
-- fixed plane through both cells, which that eye views edge-on anyway.
