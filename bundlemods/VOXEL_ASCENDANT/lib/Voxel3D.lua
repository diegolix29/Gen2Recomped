-- Voxel world mode: the 3D pass -- shader, depth buffer and camera.
--
-- World space is world PIXELS, so every coordinate the 2D paths already
-- compute drops straight in with no unit conversion:
--
--   +X  map east   (world-pixel x)
--   +Y  up         (0 is the ground plane)
--   +Z  map south  (world-pixel y)
--
-- A character at rest faces +Z, i.e. toward a camera parked to the south,
-- which is what "facing down" means in the 2D game -- and a character card
-- is drawn in exactly that pose, leaning back rather than yawing.
--
-- The camera orbits the view centre at Voxel.angle: 0 is straight down
-- (what the flat 2D view already is) and 50 degrees leans toward the
-- horizon. Distance and field of view are tied to Voxel.FOCAL, which is the
-- same constant Tilt projects with, so a given angle frames the world
-- identically in both modes -- switching between them changes the geometry,
-- not the framing.
--
-- Every GPU object is pcall-guarded and `available()` reports the result:
-- headless test runs and any driver without depth-canvas support fall back
-- to the existing tilt/flat paths rather than erroring.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- camera --

-- An explicit camera, replacing the orbit below for as long as it is set:
-- { eye = {x,y,z}, focus = {x,y,z}, fov = radians, curve = k or nil,
--   up = {x,y,z} or nil }.
--
-- A caller with matrices of its own -- the VR eyes, whose view comes from
-- a tracked pose and whose projection is an off-centre frustum no
-- eye/focus/fov triple can express -- sets `view` and `proj` instead, and
-- the eye/focus fields stay for everything that reasons about the camera
-- rather than projecting with it (setLook, the sky, the water's lean).
--
-- The orbit is the free-roam camera and it is described entirely by ONE
-- number, the pitch, because that is all a camera following the player over
-- their own map ever needs. A staged shot -- the overworld battle's
-- over-the-shoulder rig (see BattleCam) -- is a placed camera: it has a yaw,
-- it does not sit above its focus, and its framing comes from the arena
-- rather than from the view size. Rather than widen the orbit into
-- something that could express both and be the wrong shape for each, a
-- caller with a camera of its own simply hands it over.
--
-- Everything downstream is unchanged by this: the shader uniforms, project()
-- and the overlay all read Voxel3D.vp / Voxel3D.eye, which are set the same
-- way either way.
Voxel3D.camera = nil

-- This frame's camera RAY FAN, set by viewProjection alongside vp: the
-- world direction a canvas point looks along (see Sky.paint's `ray`).
-- Present for every free-pitch camera -- the VR eyes bring theirs
-- (VRRig.eyeCamera), a placed eye/focus camera gets one built -- and nil
-- for the orbit, whose frame-hung sky is the classic look.
Voxel3D.skyRayLive = nil

-- Clouds, stars and rare sky events need a ray fan even in the classic orbit
-- so switching between ORBIT and 1ST/3RD does not teleport the atmosphere.
-- The orbit still leaves skyRayLive nil and therefore keeps its established
-- frame-shaped gradient; only the discrete atmosphere uses this second fan.
Voxel3D.atmosphereRayLive = nil

-- ------- which way, and how steeply, this camera looks
--
-- Two facts about the view direction, set alongside the eye and the focus
-- because they ARE the eye and the focus, and read by anything that has to
-- reason about the camera's ATTITUDE rather than about a point in front of
-- it:
--
--   lookFlat   the view direction flattened onto the ground plane and
--              normalized -- "the way the horizon lies from here", which is
--              what a reflection leans toward at the steeper rungs (Water).
--   descent    how far below horizontal the view runs, as a sine: 0 looking
--              level, 1 looking straight down. It is the number that says
--              whether there is a horizon in frame at all, and it answers
--              the same way for the orbit and for a placed battle camera --
--              which is why this is derived from the two vectors rather than
--              read off Voxel.angle, a rung the battle camera does not have.
--
-- A camera looking exactly straight down has no horizontal direction at all,
-- and lookFlat then keeps whatever it last held rather than becoming a zero
-- vector nothing downstream could normalize.

--
-- ONE flat grey rather than a dimmed copy of the sprite, so the shape reads
-- at a glance instead of competing with whatever is showing through it --
-- and translucent rather than opaque, so it stays a hint of where the
-- player is rather than a hole punched in the building. The wall it is
-- seen through still shows, which is what keeps it reading as "behind

-- Draw a character AGAIN wherever the ordinary draw LOST the depth test.
--
-- Honest occlusion is the point of this mode -- walk behind the Mart and the
-- Mart is genuinely in front of you -- but a player who cannot see their own
-- character has lost track of where they are standing, which the flat game
-- never allowed. So the figure is drawn a second time with the test
-- INVERTED: "greater" passes exactly where "lequal" failed, and LOVE hands
-- the compare straight to glDepthFunc, so the two are true complements.
-- Every texel of the sprite is therefore drawn once and once only -- solid
-- where it is visible, translucent where it is not -- with no seam where
-- they meet and no double-blending anywhere.
--
-- Nothing is drawn at all when nothing is in the way, and no code here ever
-- asks whether the player is occluded: the depth buffer already knows, and
-- the test is the question.
--
-- Depth WRITES are off. This pass is behind the scenery by definition, and
-- writing would file the hidden figure's depth in front of the building
-- hiding it -- the grass pass at the end of the frame reads that buffer.
--
-- The caller redraws through the ordinary character path, so the ghost keeps
-- the same mesh, matrix and camera-ward PULL as the real draw. The pull
-- matching is what keeps the leaning-over-a-near-wall case out of here: pull
-- already won that fight for the solid draw, so this pass finds nothing left
-- to paint and a character merely standing close to a wall does not shimmer

-- ------------------------------------------------------- the water pass --
--
-- A reflective surface has to READ the frame it is being drawn into: the
-- colour of what is standing around it and the depth that says where. Both
-- are attachments of the target this pass is bound to, and a texture cannot
-- be sampled while it is one -- so for the length of the water draw the
-- frame is taken apart:
--
--   the COLOUR is copied to a mirror canvas, which is a texture like any
--   other and is what the reflection samples.
--
--   the DEPTH is simply detached. The water shader does the test itself
--   against the texture (see Water), which is the same comparison the
--   hardware would have made -- what it gives up is depth WRITES, and water
--   is flat, never overlaps itself, and has nothing drawn under it later.
--
-- `paint`, when given, is called with the MIRROR bound and the scene shader
-- set, to add things that must be REFLECTED without being composited yet.
--
-- The characters are the whole reason it exists. Gen 1 draws people over
-- the world and water is world, so the cast has to composite AFTER the
-- water -- but a reflection can only contain what was drawn BEFORE it, and
-- a lake with everyone standing beside it and nobody in it reads as glass.
-- Painting them into the mirror alone settles both: they are in the picture
-- the water reflects and not yet in the picture the water is drawn into.
--
-- They go down depth-TESTED and depth-WRITE-FREE. Tested, so a figure behind
-- a building is behind it in the reflection too; write-free because the very
-- next thing to read that buffer is the water's own depth test, and a cast
-- that had written to it would punch itself out of the water it is standing
-- beside.

-- readable depth canvas on this driver, or no pass open. A caller that gets
-- nil draws its water like ordinary terrain, which is what this mode always
