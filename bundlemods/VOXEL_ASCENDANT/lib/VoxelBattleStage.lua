-- The B rungs: the two discs the fight is staged on.
--
-- Where an A rung puts the fight on the MAP -- real ground, whatever the
-- route happens to look like -- a B rung puts it on two platforms against
-- the sky and draws no map at all.
--
-- ------- one stage, two rungs
--
-- The discs do not know what is standing on them. 2D-3D B stands the Game
-- Boy's own battle pics there and native cards stands the Pokemon Stadium
-- models, and this file is identical for both: it draws two platforms at two
-- cells and sizes each to whatever footprint it is given. That is why the
-- flat disc rung cost a value in the 3D-BTL ladder and nothing else.
--
-- ------- why this is a rung and not a fix
--
-- Staging on the map is the better picture when the map cooperates, and it
-- often does not. Half of Kanto's interiors are furniture; a cave floor can
-- be nothing but two-cell corridors; some maps have nowhere a fight can be
-- SEEN from a low camera and are declined outright (see BattleArena), which
-- drops the player back to the flat battle screen with no warning. And even
-- where a spot exists, the ground behind the foe is a hedge or a shop counter
-- rather than anything a battle wants behind it.
--
-- Discs have none of those problems, because the stage is CARRIED rather than
-- found: it works on every map, in every building, at every step, and the
-- framing is the same every time. What it gives up is the thing STADIUM A is
-- for -- fighting somewhere real.
--
-- ------- what stays
--
-- The sky, and the light. A battle outdoors is under the hour's own sky, with
-- its bands and its sun or moon (Voxel3D.beginScene paints it when handed a
-- dressed one); a battle in a cave or a room is under that place's own void
-- and its own neutral light, exactly as the map itself would be. So the mode
-- is abstracted from the GROUND, not from the world -- walk into a cave at
-- midnight and the fight looks like a cave at midnight.
--
-- And the framing. The camera, the pins, the HUDs, the text box, the move
-- animations and the depth of field are all identical, because every one of
-- them is hung off the arena's CELLS rather than off what is under them. That
-- is the same reason STADIUM A could be an option on the mode rather than a
-- second mode, and it is why this file is a few hundred lines and not a few
-- thousand.

--

-- because the set's footprints run nearly tenfold: a Caterpie is under four
-- world pixels across and Moltres, wings out, is twenty-six. One radius for
-- both is either a dinner plate under the caterpillar or a doily under the
-- bird.
--
-- RADIUS is the floor, and it is the number most species land on -- it is a
-- little over the map cell a Pokemon is sized to cover, which is the
-- proportion the Game Boy's own battle platforms have. PAD is the margin
-- around a mon that needs more than that, and MAX_RADIUS stops Moltres from
-- being handed something the frame cannot hold.
--
-- These are the FULL radius, out to where the fade has finished; the solid
-- centre a Pokemon actually stands on is SOLID of it. PAD is sized so that a

-- ------- the texture
--
-- The platform is a FLAT painted disc that fades out at its rim -- no rim
-- wall, no thickness, the whole thing carried in one texture on one quad
-- lying on the ground plane. That is what the Game Boy's own battle
-- platforms are, and it is what keeps the stage from competing with the
-- Pokemon standing on it.
--
-- ------- why the fade is DITHERED
--
-- The scene shader discards any texel under half alpha outright (it has to:
-- that is what keeps a sprite's transparent corners out of the depth buffer).
-- So a smooth alpha ramp does not fade -- it comes out as a hard circle cut
-- at wherever the ramp crosses 0.5, which is the one thing this must not be.
--
-- The fade is therefore an ORDERED DITHER baked into the texture's alpha:
-- every texel is fully on or fully off, and the proportion that are on falls
-- away toward the rim. It is the same trick the sky already uses for its
-- bands (Sky.DITHER), it needs no shader change and so risks nothing in any
-- other pass, and on a mode built out of visible texels it reads as intended
-- rather than as a limitation.
--
-- The COLOUR is deliberately neutral. Everything the shader does to it after
-- this is the environment's: Voxel3D.tint carries the hour outdoors and the
-- room's own flat light indoors, and the shadow pass darkens whatever the
-- Pokemon standing on it occludes. So one texture is a sunlit platform, a
-- dusk platform and a cave platform, without a variant for each.
