-- Overworld battles: fights that happen on the map you were standing on.
--
-- The engine's battle is a screen: a white field with two pics on it, pushed
-- over a frozen overworld that stops drawing. This turns that white field
-- into the world -- the same terrain the free-roam mode extrudes, shot from
-- a placed over-the-shoulder camera at a clear patch of ground nearby --
-- while leaving the battle ITSELF alone. Every pic, HUD, HP bar, move
-- animation, faint slide and text box is the engine's own, drawn in the
-- engine's own order. What changes is what is behind them, and where the two
-- pics stand.
--
-- The sequence, from the moment something picks a fight:
--
--   1. the overworld cast is culled -- every NPC vanishes, so the wipe
--      plays over an empty map and no bystander is left standing in the
--      arena shot
--   2. the engine's own transition wipes the screen (untouched: it is the
--      right wipe, picked by the right three bits)
--   3. the battle draws over a live, window-resolution render of the arena,
--      with each mon PINNED to the cell it is standing on, the camera
--      drifting slowly enough to read as parallax, and a depth-of-field pass
--      holding the slab of world the two of them occupy sharp
--   4. the battle ends, the cast comes back, and the player is exactly
--      where they were standing
--
-- WHAT DOES NOT MOVE. The arena is where the CAMERA goes, not where the
-- player goes: nothing here writes a cell, a facing, a flag or a warp. A
-- real warp would have to survive trainer sight-lines, post-battle
-- dialogue, the blackout path and every script that assumes the player is
-- where it left them -- and it would have to put them back afterwards.
-- Moving the camera buys the whole shot and owes nothing back.
--
-- The feature declines cleanly rather than half-working: no depth support,
-- no open ground on the map, the row switched off, or a mesh still building
-- all end at the same place, which is the battle screen the engine has
-- always drawn.

--
-- So each block is snapped to its own side: the foe's to the left edge of the
-- window, the player's to the right. Nothing about either block changes -- same
-- tiles, same size, same rows, drawn by the engine's own DrawEnemyHUDAndHPBar

-- of the GB screen there is nowhere to go and the snap is a no-op.
--
-- They cannot simply be MOVED there: the engine draws them into the 160x144 UI
-- canvas and everything outside it is clipped away. So the layer is rendered to
-- a texture and composited into the WORLD image instead, which is the one
-- surface in this mode that covers the whole window.

-- The rows each block is cut out of, full width. Generous on purpose:
-- AnimationShakeEnemyHUD nudges the foe's block sideways, a long name reaches
-- further than the panel does, and the pokeball rows and the safari ball count
-- belong to the block whose rows they sit in. Nothing drawHUDs draws lies

-- the frosted panels are cut to, and the full-frame white intercepted to let
-- the world through. BATTLE LAYOUT's WIDE lays the same battle out on a
-- 304x144 surface (src/battle/WideBattle.lua), which moves every one of those
-- -- the mons would stand where no camera was solved for them, and the panels
-- would land beside the HUDs they are supposed to be under.

-- top state for its surface the same way), so writing it here lands on the
