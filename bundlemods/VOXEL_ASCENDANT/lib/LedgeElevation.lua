-- Visual base elevation implied by Gen 1's one-way ledges.
--
-- Gameplay already owns ledges.  `data.field.ledges` says that, for one
-- tileset, a player standing on S may press/facing `dir` when the next cell
-- L carries `ledgeTile`; the engine then hops over L and lands on T.  That
-- direction is also the missing visual fact: S is the high side, T the low
-- side, and the lip's authored six-pixel height is the difference.  L itself
-- keeps the LOW datum: TileShape already makes that artwork six pixels tall,
-- so its top meets S instead of being raised twice.
--
-- This module never changes collision, map data or a shared TileShape.  It
-- derives an immutable, cacheable CELL-height snapshot for gameplay-sized
-- consumers plus an 8px TILE-height snapshot for the renderer.  That second
-- view matters at the lip itself: a Gen 1 ledge collision cell is 16px deep,
-- but its authored six-pixel face occupies only one 8px half.  The other half
-- is plateau art and must keep the high datum, otherwise the mesh cuts an
-- eight-pixel trench immediately behind every otherwise-correct ledge.
--
-- A lip is a LOCAL contour, not permission to raise its whole map row or
-- column.  Same-direction occurrences on the same line are joined into one
-- run; a one- or two-cell walkable road opening may join neighbouring pieces
-- of that run because the upper and lower terrace continue across the road.
-- Nothing outside the run's tangential span is affected.  Perpendicular
-- signed sweeps then integrate those bounded contours: successive real runs
-- add courses, opposed runs bound a ridge/trench, and a short ledge cannot
-- manufacture a terrace elsewhere on the map.
--
-- Non-walkable scenery follows the selected interpretation. LOCAL keeps one
-- connected mass at its lowest adjacent ground datum. WORLD instead assigns
-- each blocked cell to its nearest walkable surface, so rocks/bollards beside
-- a terrace rise with that terrace while the same frame can return to the
-- lower datum beyond its stair opening. Equal-distance ties prefer the higher
-- surface, keeping the visible plateau rim closed without lifting unrelated
-- roads.
--
-- SLICE is the deliberately safer middle ground: it accepts only contours
-- that contain a real one- or two-cell walkable opening between authored ledge
-- pieces. Those openings are the map's visual evidence for stairs. The local
-- plateau and its retaining scenery are raised, but no datum crosses a map
-- connection and an isolated jump ledge cannot lift a town or pond.

-- historical conservative object treatment. FLAT is the safe default: it
-- removes both the derived terrace datum and the intrinsic ledge lift, so a
-- hedge break that happens to reuse Gen-I ledge collision art cannot cut a
-- six-pixel niche into otherwise level ground. Real stairs and structures
-- retain their own geometry.
