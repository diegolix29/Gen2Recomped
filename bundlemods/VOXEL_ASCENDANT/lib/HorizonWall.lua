-- a bounded set of batched large quads. It deliberately does NOT enlarge
-- an arbitrary border block: many Kanto maps use houses, gates or statues as
-- their most frequent edge block, which made the old curtain look like giant
-- wallpaper. Location-specific compact Fuji/town/forest images are baked into
-- the same retained targets as procedural fallbacks; the scene shader still
-- applies the map's time-of-day colour grade. The horizontal cap keeps orbit
-- cameras from seeing a paper edge.
