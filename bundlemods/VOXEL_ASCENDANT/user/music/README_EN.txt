VOXEL ASCENDANT 2.0.1 - ADD YOUR OWN MUSIC (ENGLISH)
====================================================

VASC does not ship copyrighted replacement music. These folders are a local,
user-controlled interface. Your files remain in your own installation.

QUICK SETUP
-----------
1. Close the game before copying or renaming files.
2. Open the installed VASC folder, then user/music/.
3. Copy MP3, OGG, WAV or FLAC files into the matching category folder.
4. Start the game and open VASC -> USER MUSIC -> RESCAN FOLDERS.
5. Turn CUSTOM MUSIC ON.
6. Open a category and choose ORIGINAL, SHUFFLE, or one named file.

SHUFFLE chooses a track again for each matching battle or cue and avoids an
immediate repeat when more than one valid file exists. If a file is missing,
invalid, removed, or cannot be decoded, VASC safely keeps the final Game/KASC
track. VASC uses the normal game music player, including its volume, pause,
resume, and battle-exit behaviour.

CATEGORY FOLDERS
----------------
  wild/        ordinary wild and Safari battles
  trainer/     ordinary trainer battles
  rival/       rival battles
  gym/         Gym Leader battles
  elite4/      Elite Four battles
  champion/    Champion battles
  field/       overworld and map music
  bike/        bicycle music
  surf/        surfing music
  victory/     post-battle victory music
  evolution/   evolution, hatching, and trade evolution
  title/       title-screen music
  halloffame/  Hall of Fame music
  credits/     credits music
  jingle/      short one-shot cues
  scene/       Oak speech, encounters, and other scripted scenes

File names inside category folders are display names only. Examples:
  wild/Johto Wild.mp3
  gym/My Gym Theme.ogg
  field/Night Route.flac

EXACT GAME/KASC SONG REPLACEMENT
--------------------------------
The replace/ folder is the advanced fallback for every music cue that has no
dedicated category. Name the file exactly like the resolved Game/KASC song ID:
  replace/Music_WildBattle.mp3
  replace/<ORIGINAL_SONG_ID>.ogg

The filename stem is case-sensitive on some devices. Only letters, digits,
underscore, dot, and hyphen are accepted for an exact ID. A selected category
track intentionally takes precedence over an exact replacement in the same
category. Open EXACT SONG REPLACEMENTS after a rescan to verify which files
VASC accepted.

AUDITIONING ORIGINAL AND CUSTOM MUSIC
-------------------------------------
Open a category and choose MUSIC A/B PREVIEW. VASC can play each custom
file and the last Game/KASC cue it actually observed for that category without
changing the saved ORIGINAL / SHUFFLE / file selection. STOP + RESTORE, or
leaving the preview screen, stops the audition and resumes the song that was
playing beforehand.

An ORIGINAL row remains unavailable until that kind of cue has really resolved
in the current game session. A category can represent many map or trainer songs,
so VASC deliberately shows LAST ORIGINAL rather than inventing one fixed song.
In EXACT SONG REPLACEMENTS, choose an accepted song ID to open the same original
versus custom A/B preview. Its original also remains unavailable until that exact
Game/KASC ID has been observed. ROM and synthesized chip songs are previewed by
the normal game music engine; they do not need an external audio file.

RESTORING THE ORIGINAL GAME/KASC MUSIC
--------------------------------------
- In one category, choose ORIGINAL.
- In USER MUSIC, choose BACK TO GAME / KASC to reset all music categories and
  the optional VASC battle-music pack selector.
- In the main VASC menu, choose ALL TO GAME/KASC to reset both music and sprite
  customisation at once.

These actions do not delete your files. Custom music is OFF by default, so a
fresh install always preserves the final cue selected by Game/KASC.

WHERE THE INSTALLED FOLDER IS
-----------------------------
Append this to the active game save directory:
  mods/VOXEL_ASCENDANT/user/music/

Windows:
  %APPDATA%\LOVE\pokemon-love2d\mods\VOXEL_ASCENDANT\user\music\

macOS:
  ~/Library/Application Support/LOVE/pokemon-love2d/mods/
  VOXEL_ASCENDANT/user/music/

Linux:
  ~/.local/share/love/pokemon-love2d/mods/VOXEL_ASCENDANT/user/music/

iPhone/iPad:
  Files -> On My iPhone -> gen1recomp++ -> mods -> VOXEL_ASCENDANT ->
  user -> music
  iOS exposes the app Documents folder directly; there is no additional
  pokemon-love2d folder on current builds.

Android:
  Internal storage/Android/data/com.theboisclub.pokemonred/files/save/
  pokemon-love2d/mods/VOXEL_ASCENDANT/user/music/
  Modern Android may hide Android/data from its stock Files app. Use a USB
  connection or a file manager that can access the app's external-files
  directory. Do not root the device for VASC.

Nintendo Switch:
  sdmc:/switch/gen1recomp/pokemon-love2d/mods/VOXEL_ASCENDANT/user/music/

Xbox Dev Mode:
  Gen1Recomp/LocalState/pokemon-love2d/mods/VOXEL_ASCENDANT/user/music/
  Access LocalState through Xbox Device Portal.

Portable desktop builds may use the mods/ folder beside the executable. Edit
the copy the launcher currently lists as installed. The VASC START help also
shows the platform roots.

UPDATES AND TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------------------
- Back up VOXEL_ASCENDANT/user/ before replacing or updating the whole mod.
- Do not put folders inside a category; scanning is intentionally one level.
- A renamed extension does not convert audio. Use a real MP3/OGG/WAV/FLAC.
- Rescan after every copy, rename, or removal.
- If playback fails, choose ORIGINAL first. The game/KASC cue must still play.
- Never redistribute music unless you have the necessary rights.
