-- Where each map's battles happen.
--
-- Reviewed fallback spots per area. BattleArena first accepts a nearby,
-- visible clearing on the player's own elevation; these records cover places
-- where no such local shot exists and let long routes/caves provide several
-- geographically distinct, photographed compositions instead of one repeated
-- postcard. "Open ground" alone is not enough: a hedge, ledge lip or house
-- corner along the low camera line can hide a Pokemon completely.
--
-- Each entry is the arena's north-west corner in map CELLS, and which of
-- BattleArena.SHAPES it is. Picked by tools/arena_pick (BattleArena.search
-- with the clearance test on, from the middle of the map) and then looked at,
-- one screenshot per map -- these are eyeballed answers, not just passing
-- ones. Grass and flowers around a mon's feet are fine and wanted; anything
-- that cuts into a body is not.
--
-- A map with no entry here falls back to the nearest-clear search at battle
-- time, so a mod that adds maps, or an entry that goes stale against an
-- edited map, degrades to the old behaviour rather than to no battle.
--
-- The entries below are generated; regenerate with
--
--   SHOT_DIR=.scratchpad/arenas \
--   POKEPORT_DRIVER=mods/DramaticShapeVoxelMod/tests/arena_pick.lua love .

-- `cam = "wide"` on an entry swaps the long default lens for the 44-degree
-- one (BattleCam.RIGS). Both frame the same composition -- the two mons land
-- on the same screen anchors either way -- so it is purely a choice about how
-- much of the place is in shot, at the cost of a smaller pair. Rooms the long
-- lens cannot stand back from NEED it; anywhere that simply reads better with
-- more of itself visible may ask for it.
--
-- Tall grass is never part of an arena (BattleArena.openCell rejects it), so
-- a route's spot is always its bare path rather than the field beside it --
-- grass is knee-high geometry to a Pokemon and this camera is nearly level
-- with the floor, so tufts on the mon's own tile stand between it and the
-- lens. Flowers are left alone: they are ankle height and read as ground.

  -- fight at the edge of the world instead of on the road.
  --
  -- Of the seventeen spots the route has outside that border, fourteen are
  -- this one mid-route clearing and the other three bury the near mon behind
  -- a hedge -- which the clearance test passes, since it measures terrain
  -- height along the sightline and a hedge in the apron row is not terrain.
  -- So the choice is where in the clearing, and this is its west end: tree
  -- line square behind the pair, nothing crossing either of them.
