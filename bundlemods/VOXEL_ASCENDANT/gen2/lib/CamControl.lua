-- The player's own camera controls: zoom everywhere, and the battle's orbit.
--
-- This mod has four cameras, and by the time a wheel notch arrives they all
-- want it. So one module owns the INPUTS and answers the only question that
-- matters -- which camera is this aimed at -- rather than each camera
-- growing its own wheel handler and racing the others for the event:
--
--   a staged battle      the camera the fight is shot with (BattleCam): the
--                        wheel and Q/E work its lens, and the right stick,
--                        a drag or the mouse walk it around the arena.
--
--   the 3RD rung         the boom behind the player's shoulder
--                        (ThirdPerson): the wheel, Q/E and a pinch let it
--                        out and pull it in.
--
--   an orbit rung        the engine's own survey zoom, which the wheel has
--                        always driven -- so here the module mostly gets
--                        out of the way, and only ADDS the two keys and the
--                        pinch that the engine has no handler for.
--
--   the 1ST rung         nothing. The eye is in the player's head; there is
--                        no distance to change, and a pinch there would
--                        silently wind the survey zoom for whenever they
--                        stepped back out. Inputs pass through untouched.
--
-- Every claim is answered by a GATE rather than by a mode flag, and every
-- wrap forwards whatever it does not claim -- so with voxel mode off, and
-- on every screen that is not the overworld or a battle, each byte flows
-- exactly where it always did.
--
-- Installed AFTER FirstPerson (see main.lua), which makes these wraps the
-- outer ones: a battle's controls get first refusal on the mouse and the
-- touch screen, which is right, because while a fight is staged the
-- free-roam look is not driving anyway.
