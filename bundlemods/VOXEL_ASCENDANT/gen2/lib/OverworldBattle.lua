-- Overworld battles: fights that happen on the map you were standing on.
--
-- The engine's battle is a screen: a white field with two pics on it, pushed
-- over a frozen overworld that stops drawing. This turns that white field
-- into the world -- the same terrain AND the same free-roam camera the
-- encounter was already using. Gold no longer cuts to a separately staged
-- battle camera; the battle UI is layered over the frozen overworld itself --
-- while leaving the battle ITSELF alone. Every pic, HUD, HP bar, move
-- animation, faint slide and text box is the engine's own, drawn in the
-- engine's own order. What changes is what is behind them, and where the two
-- pics stand.
--
-- The sequence, from the moment something picks a fight:
--
--   1. the overworld cast is culled -- every NPC vanishes, so the wipe
--      plays over an empty map and no bystander is left standing in the
--      arena shot
--   2. the engine's own transition wipes the screen (untouched: it is the
--      right wipe, picked by the right three bits)
--   3. on Gold, the battle draws over the frozen free-roam voxel frame at the
--      encounter site, using the exact overworld camera that was already on
--      screen. Stadium models stand in that world; the battle never changes
--      to a second arena camera
--   4. the battle ends, the cast comes back, and the player is exactly
--      where they were standing
--
-- WHAT DOES NOT MOVE. The arena is where the CAMERA goes, not where the
-- player goes: nothing here writes a cell, a facing, a flag or a warp. A
-- real warp would have to survive trainer sight-lines, post-battle
-- dialogue, the blackout path and every script that assumes the player is
-- where it left them -- and it would have to put them back afterwards.
-- Moving the camera buys the whole shot and owes nothing back.
--
-- The feature declines cleanly rather than half-working: no depth support,
-- no open ground on the map, the row switched off, or a mesh still building
-- all end at the same place, which is the battle screen the engine has
-- always drawn.

--              on the MAP              on two DISCS
--   pics       2D-3D A                 2D-3D B
--   models     STADIUM A               STADIUM B
--
--   2D-3D A    the mode this file was written for: the fight is staged on
--              the map and the two Pokemon are the GB's OWN PICS, stood up
--              on their tiles as quads (BattleBillboard).
--   2D-3D B    those same pics on a pair of DISCS against the sky, with no
--              map at all (see lib/StadiumStage.lua). The Game Boy's own
--              framing with the Game Boy's own art, in three dimensions --
--              and, like every B rung, it works everywhere, including the
--              caves and shop floors that have nowhere to stage a fight.
--   STADIUM A  the staged fight with the Pokemon Stadium battle models in
--              place of those quads -- skinned, animated, and playing the
--              animation the move being used actually calls for (see
--              lib/Stadium.lua). The world is still the world: the fight
--              happens on real ground, in the map's own weather and light.
--   STADIUM B  the models on the discs: both halves swapped at once.
--   OFF        the engine's own white battle screen.
--
-- A and B is the STAGE and it is the same stage either way -- the discs do
-- not know what is standing on them and BattleScene draws them off
-- `arena.discs` alone, which is why the second column cost a value in this
-- table and nothing else. The four combinations are all reachable rather
-- than only the diagonal, because a player who cannot use the STADIUM rungs
-- -- no ROM, or a ROM they would rather not go and find -- should still be
-- able to have the disc framing, and because the discs are the answer to
-- "this map has nowhere to fight" whichever art is standing on them.
--
-- 2D-3D A stays FIRST because ModSetting's values[1] is both the default and
-- what an unrecognised stored value falls back to, and the stored value for
-- this row has been `true` since the row existed. Keeping `true` at the head
-- means every save written before the later rungs existed reads back as the
-- 2D-3D it was written for, and a mod whose headline is "the world in 3D"
-- still does not need the player to go and find the switch.
--
-- Every other stored value is likewise the one it has always been --
-- "stadium" from before there was a B, "stadiumB" from before there was a
-- flat one -- so no save loses the mode it chose.
--
-- Both STADIUM rungs are GATED on the models existing: the mod ships no
-- Pokemon Stadium data, and until the player's own ROM has been found and
-- built from (StadiumInstall) the row simply has two fewer stops. See
-- ModSetting.setGate for why they are skipped rather than shown and refused.
-- 2D-3D B is NOT gated: its stage is generated in Lua and its Pokemon are
-- the game's own art, so it needs nothing the base game did not ship.

-- the field's own colour when the field was white and is a sheet of paper laid

--
-- So the box gets exactly what the HUDs get: the world behind it, blurred to
-- frosted glass and laid back down translucent, with the border and the text
-- drawn over it unchanged, and the same brightness verdict flipping the ink
-- when the ground under it is dark. Only the FILL is taken away -- every glyph
-- the engine draws inside the box is still the engine's own, in its own place.
--
-- These are the boxes BattleState:drawTextArea lays down, as GB-frame rects.
-- READ-ONLY duplicates of that function's own branches, the same kind of
-- mirror hudLive is and for the same reason: there is no seam that reports "a
-- move menu is up", and glass has to go down BEFORE the box that sits on it.
-- The worst a future engine change can do is frost a rectangle nothing lands
-- on, or leave a box unfrosted -- never break a battle.

-- ------- the HUDs, out at the window's own edges
--

-- whole of it. That left both HUD blocks huddled together in the middle of the
-- frame with map showing on either side of them, which reads as a Game Boy
-- screenshot pasted over a diorama rather than as the diorama's own furniture.
--
-- So each block is snapped to its own side: the foe's to the left edge of the
-- window, the player's to the right. Nothing about either block changes -- same
-- tiles, same size, same rows, drawn by the engine's own DrawEnemyHUDAndHPBar
-- and DrawPlayerHUDAndHPBar -- only where the pair sits. On a window the shape
-- of the GB screen there is nowhere to go and the snap is a no-op.
--
-- They cannot simply be MOVED there: the engine draws them into the 160x144 UI
-- canvas and everything outside it is clipped away. So the layer is rendered to
-- a texture and composited into the WORLD image instead, which is the one
-- surface in this mode that covers the whole window.

-- The rows each block is cut out of, full width. Generous on purpose:
-- AnimationShakeEnemyHUD nudges the foe's block sideways, a long name reaches
-- further than the panel does, and the pokeball rows and the safari ball count
-- belong to the block whose rows they sit in. Nothing drawHUDs draws lies

-- move-animation flash (which is white at 0.85) all pass through untouched.

-- colour, so tinting the colour tints the pixels -- and the alpha, the faint
-- slide's fade and the blink's own colour all compose with it rather than
-- being overwritten.
--
-- What this does NOT get is the sun: the cards are shadow-mapped, so one
