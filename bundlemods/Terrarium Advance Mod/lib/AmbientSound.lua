-- Voxel world mode: the sound of the place.
--
-- The diorama has butterflies, fireflies, birds crossing the sky and grass
-- bending in the wind, and all of it happens in silence over the map's own
-- looping song. This is the other half: crickets after dark, birdsong in the
-- morning, water moving where there is water to move, rain when it rains --
-- and, occasionally, the cry of a Pokemon that is actually standing on the
-- map (a wild roamer or a town pet). Never a species list of its own.
--
-- ------- recorded, with the synth kept underneath it
--
-- This shipped once as pure synthesis -- every sound a Game Boy channel
-- program, not a byte of audio on disk -- and it was the wrong call. The
-- reasoning was sound and the result was not: a square-wave blip is a
-- convincing menu beep and an unconvincing cricket, and at the level ambience
-- has to sit, under the map's own looping song, a thin blip is not quiet, it
-- is inaudible. The synth reproduces a Game Boy's sound effects perfectly,
-- because that is exactly what they are. It cannot do a field at dusk,
-- because a field at dusk is a hundred overlapping sources and the hardware
-- has four.
--
-- So the beds are real recordings now, in `assets/audio/`, all CC0 --
-- see that folder's CREDITS.md for who recorded each and for why nothing here
-- is CC-BY or CC-BY-SA.
--
-- The channel programs are still here and still registered, one per bed, and
-- they earn their place as the FALLBACK: a file missing, an assets folder
-- stripped out of a build, a driver that will not decode Vorbis. Then the bed
-- drops to the synth and the ambience is worse rather than gone. That is what
-- the programs were always actually good for.
--
-- They are registered ids either way (`TR_AMB_CRICKET` and friends), so a
-- sound pack can override one through the engine's own sfx registry.
--
-- ------- beds, not blips
--
-- The other half of what was wrong, and the deeper half. Crickets were
-- scheduled as discrete chirps on a countdown -- which is what the synth
-- could manage -- but a real cricket field is one continuous thing whose
-- LEVEL moves. So the beds LOOP, and what the world does is crossfade them:
-- nightfall brings the crickets up rather than switching them on, walking
-- away from a river takes the river down, a shower brings the rain up over
-- ten seconds beside the sky going grey. Only thunder is a one-shot, because
-- a thunderclap is one.
--
-- ------- what decides each level
--
-- The same clocks the rest of the mod runs on. DayNight says what hour it is
-- (crickets at night, the dawn chorus in the morning), Weather says what is
-- coming down, Wind how hard the air is moving, WaterBody how big the water
-- nearby is, and the map itself says whether there is water within earshot
-- -- counted by LOOKING, in cells, rather than by a list of maps with ponds
-- on them. Indoors the outdoor beds stop but two stay: RAIN KEEPS PLAYING
-- INDOORS, quieter and pitched down, and a soft room-tone so a house is not
-- a hard silence; caves and underpasses get their own bed instead.
--
-- Deliberately NOT gated on voxel mode. Every other ambient thing in this mod
-- is a drawing and needs a diorama to be drawn on; a sound needs no camera,
-- so the flat 2D world gets the crickets too.

-- ------- the recordings
--

-- the product for one version and they were the wrong answer: a square wave
-- blip is a convincing menu beep and an unconvincing cricket, and at the
-- level ambience wants to sit -- under the map's own music -- a thin blip is
-- not quiet, it is inaudible. The synth can do a Game Boy's sound effects
-- because that is what a Game Boy's sound effects are. It cannot do a field
-- at dusk, because a field at dusk is a hundred overlapping sources and the
-- hardware has four.
--
-- So the real thing, recorded, in `assets/audio/`. Every file is CC0 -- see
-- that folder's CREDITS.md for who recorded each one, and for why nothing
-- here is CC-BY or CC-BY-SA (a share-alike recording would reach out and set
-- terms on the whole mod).
--
-- The programs stay, and stay registered, for the case that matters: a file
-- missing, a build without the assets folder, a driver that will not decode
-- Vorbis. Then the bed falls back to the synth and the feature is worse
-- rather than gone.
--
-- ------- and they are BEDS, not blips
--
-- The other half of what was wrong. Crickets were scheduled as discrete
-- chirps on a countdown, which is what the synth could manage; a recording of
-- crickets is a continuous field whose LEVEL moves. So the beds loop and are
-- crossfaded by how much of them the world wants right now -- night brings
-- the crickets up, walking away from the water takes the water down, a shower
-- brings the rain up over ten seconds. Only thunder is a one-shot, because a
-- thunderclap is one.

-- ------- decoding
--
-- Decoded to a SoundData and rebuilt into a Source rather than handed to
-- love.audio.newSource as a path, and the reason is the loop seam.
--
-- A looping Source repeats its buffer end to start with no gap, so a bed only
-- sounds continuous if the BUFFER starts and ends in the sound. Dead air on
-- either end becomes a hole you hear once every time round and then cannot
-- stop hearing.
--
-- The first cut of this comment blamed MP3 encoder padding, which is the
-- famous cause and, here, the wrong one. Measured (tests/ambient_beds_probe):
--
--     crickets.mp3   head    0   tail     0 samples
--     rain.ogg       head    0   tail     0
--     water.ogg      head    0   tail     0
--     birds.ogg      head 3104   tail 36817   -- 65ms + 767ms
--     thunder.ogg    head 1919   tail 39786   -- 40ms + 829ms
--
-- The decoder already handles the MP3's padding, and the two files that need
-- trimming are Oggs -- not because of their format but because the person
-- recording them left the tape running. Which is the better argument for
-- doing this at all: the fix is not for a format quirk, it is for recordings,
-- and every recording anyone drops into that folder later gets it too.
--
-- Cost, on the machine this was written on: 104ms to decode the longest file
-- and 16ms to copy it (1.5M stereo samples). Once per bed per session, on the
-- frame that bed first comes up, and the trim is skipped outright for the
