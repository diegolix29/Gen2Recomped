# Roadmap / backlog

Living list of work that is **not** closed. Prefer a GitHub issue when one
exists; this file is the map when issues are not filed yet.

File drafts on GitHub (after `gh auth login`):

| item | issue | notes |

| Bridge to installed PokePC Followers | [#9](https://github.com/BrenoBertucci/Terrarium/issues/9) | use their sheets without a second copy |

## Done recently (unreleased until next package)

- Ambient Tier 1 beds + CC0 credits + source→build policy for audio
- Roamer policy: no redistributed Gen-2 sheets; installer + improved bake
  fallback (`RoamerArt.REV` 3); `trueColor` when sheets present
- Water size / swell fixes in 1.20.0-mobile (shipped)

## Policy reminders

- **No Nintendo / third-party art in the zip** without an explicit licence
  (X/Y GUI, roamer walk sheets). Install scripts only.
- **Ambient audio: CC0 1.0 only** — no CC-BY, no Pixabay/ZapSplat “royalty
  free” terms. See `assets/audio/CREDITS.md`.
- **Licence of the fork itself** is still open upstream — see README.
