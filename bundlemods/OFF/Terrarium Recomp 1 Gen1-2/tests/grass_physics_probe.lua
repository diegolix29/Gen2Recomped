-- Probe: the grass PHYSICS pass -- 3D tuft bend, weather load, foot springs,
-- the AUTO wind row, and the wind's own VFX.
--
-- Five questions, each answered with a number rather than an impression:
--
--   1  AUTO spans      does the AUTO row actually travel from near-still on
--                      a clear day to gale under a front, without anybody
--                      touching the menu?
--   2  load reaches    do rain (falling) and snow (settled) arrive at the
--                      grass as Wind.grassWet / Wind.grassSnow, and do they
--                      DAMP the lean rather than merely coexist with it?
--   3  springs         does a foot leaving a tuft let it stand back up over
--                      time, and does it overshoot past upright on the way?
--   4  air is visible  does WindFX carry streaks once the air is over its
--                      floor, and does a gust throw a front?
--   5  it still draws  screenshots, because a shader that fails to compile
--                      fails silently and every number above still passes
--                      (the battle-HUD ink lesson).

  -- about forty full cycles. Sampled that way the whole average happens

  -- `amount`, one front, nothing drifting underneath -- and the mean is
  -- over dozens of periods instead of a fraction of one.
