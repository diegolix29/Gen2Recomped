-- Probe: WHAT THE DIAL ACTUALLY SPENDS ITS TIME ON, and what colour comes
-- out at a locked clock.
--
-- The mod owns six phase palettes and six tints. Reading DayNight.PALETTES
-- you would think the cycle wears six colours. It does not: four of the six
-- are WAYPOINTS the blends pass through, and the dial holds them for about a
-- second each. A screenshot cannot show that -- every frame you shoot is a
-- legitimate blend of two real palettes, so every frame looks defensible and
-- the fact that `dusk` is never actually painted is invisible.
--
-- So this probe answers two questions, both as integers:
--
--   1. DWELL. For each phase, how many of the 1200 seconds does it hold at
--      full weight, and how many does it lead (weight >= 0.5)? That is a
--      pure function of DayNight.mix and needs no frame drawn at all. A dial
--      change is a diff of this table.
--
--   2. RAMP. At a locked clock, on a fixed 50-second grid, what do
--      DayNight.palette / tint / glow / windowLight / shearAt / strengthAt
--      and Light.split actually return? Colour is a number here, not a
--      photograph: a palette change is a table diff, and that is the proof.
--      Sky.bands is read too, because it is the only one of these that can
--      silently shorten the list (PaletteFX replaces the palette outright in
--      the DMG display modes) -- so the band COUNT is logged, not assumed.
--
-- The screenshots at the end are confirmation, never evidence: same map,
-- same camera rung, same weather, and the clock pinned frame by frame so a
-- shot is of an hour rather than of an animation.
